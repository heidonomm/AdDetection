O,"Thank you , Bill ."
O,Thanks to all of you .
O,"Wonderful , grateful people who are not , in fact , in this closet applauding for me ."
O,"That's , of course , canned applause played by our trusty producer , Mike ."
O,"Now , this particular applause was our audience back in January of 2017 ."
O,APPLAUDING for special guest host Tom Hanks .
O,There's really nothing like the sound of people loudly enjoying one's absence .
O,"Anyway , we have invited Mr. Hanks back ."
O,He'll be joining us later to play .
O,Not my job at this time .
O,"Tom , I'm not going anywhere ."
O,Of course .
O,"Was it a sound effect , Peter ?"
O,That was my voice .
O,I apologize .
O,Nobody is going anywhere .
O,So we assume you are free to give us a call and play our games .
O,The number is 1 triple-A .
O,"Wait , wait ."
O,Or 1 8 8 8 9 2 4 8 9 2 4 .

O,I'm in the line of Georgia .
O,"Well , how are things in Atlanta ?"
O,"It's pretty quiet , the places I'm working at ."
O,"Oh , wow ."
O,Why do I even bother asking ?
O,I should say .
O,"How are things inside your house , I guess ?"
O,What name is everywhere ?
O,"When you were allowed to leave your house , what do you do ?"
O,I work security for the CDC and I'm a Army reservist .
O,Wait a minute .
O,You work for the CDC ?
O,I work security .
O,I just I way but the smart people .
O,All right .
O,And you wave at the smart people and presumably they wave back .
O,Do you think those smart people know what they're doing ?
O,"You know , they they seem like they're really on top every time ."
O,"Oh , good ."
O,I'm I'm I'm very glad to hear it .
O,Let me introduce you .
O,Grant to our panel this week .
O,"First up , it's a writer , performer and the co-host of the podcast ."
O,Nobody Listens to Paula POUNDSTONE .
O,It's Adam FELBER .
O,I think .
O,"Next , she's the host of the Fake The Nation podcast , and you can now stream her last film , Third Street Blackout for free because let's face it , you have run out of things to watch by now ."
O,It's Negin Farsad .
O,"Imam and an actor and writer who directed the new audible original series Escape from Virtual Island , featuring Paul Rudd , it's Peter GROSZ ."
O,"Grant , welcome to the show ."
O,You're going to play Who's Bill This Time ?
O,Bill KURTIS is going to read you three quotations from this week's news .
O,"If you can correctly identify or explain just two of them , you'll win our prize ."
O,Any voice from our show you may choose on your voicemail .
O,You're ready to play .
O,"Yes , sir ."
O,Here is your first quote .
O,Normal .
O,It will not be .
O,That was California Governor Yoda .
O,Gavin Newsom talking about to open up .
O,What ?
O,Trying to open up the economy .
O,Open up city ?
O,Yeah .
O,"Basically , everything ."
O,"Whatever we do , people say we won't be able to go back to normal right away ."
O,"For example , restaurants will open , but they'll have to stagger the table so nobody's anywhere near each other ."
O,Servers .
O,"Remember , throw entrees from the left , receive flying dirty plates from the right , crowded bistros ."
O,You will not have wait .
O,"But my my understanding is if the restaurants are going to be at half capacity , then we actually get double the food ."
O,Right .
O,That's how it's going to work .
O,Yeah .
O,"Amy , that's that's your excuse for going out and ordering two entrees ."
O,I'm helping you guys not stress eating .
O,I'll have a chicken parmesan and al-Hasani .
O,Thank you very much .
O,"If they really want to keep people apart in restaurants , they should just make it awful to go there ."
O,"For example , every other table is a bad first tinder date ."
O,I feel .
O,"I feel so bad for people who are like , I just got out of a long term relationship and I'm ready ."
O,Know how much a new people did not get her groove back in the middle of a pandemic ?
O,"No , not now ."
O,"Nobody really knows why President Trump is obsessed about opening up the country on May 1st , except it's May Day ."
O,"That's the thing you say when you're going down in flames or the president did say he had the , quote , absolute power to open the country ."
O,"But the next day after he was visited by three spirits in the night , he admitted he couldn't really do that ."
O,"He did create a committee to reopen the economy with such brilliant public health experts as Ivanka Trump , Mr. Ivanka Trump , Pennywise the Clown , Voldemort and Wilbur Ross ."
O,"All right , Grant , here's your next quote ."
O,Do you wear a suit ?
O,Got a podium for your house .
O,That was a lawyer worrying about how to argue a case now that the Supreme Court will be hearing those cases .
O,How remotely through video ?
O,"Yes , I'll give it to you ."
O,They're going to do it over the phone .
O,It's true .
O,Many people are discovering the wonder of phone calls .
O,It's just like a Xoom meeting .
O,But you don't have to put on a shirt either .
O,"The Supreme Court had canceled their spring session , but all these civil liberties were just piling up and somebody has to get rid of them ."
O,So they've agreed for the first time in its long history to conduct hearings by conference call .
O,They'll still be wearing robes .
O,But who knows what's under them ?
O,"And this is also for the first time , the public can listen in live ."
O,This has never happened before .
O,"Come for the council's arguments , the justices sharp questions ."
O,And Clarence Thomas is heavy breathing .
O,"Yeah , I'm really looking forward to hearing him say nothing ."
O,I love this .
O,"I love this story so much as I totally picture one of those moments where someone's like , you want the truth ."
O,"And then Ruth Bader Ginsburg is like , what ?"
O,Who's talking ?
O,You know the truth .
O,I'm sorry .
O,You have to hide yourself .
O,"I may be able to handle the truth , but I don't ."
O,"Speaking every 20 minutes , you're gonna have to wait while Ruth Ginsburg says , excuse me , I have to go get some more nickels , guys ."
O,She needs the lift .
O,We need to stop joking about it .
O,I do not .
O,I am not comfortable with this line of questioning .
O,This is a joke about how she's a Luddite .
O,Not that chief .
O,"Oh , I was going bewailed ."
O,Is there a reason why is there a reason why it's not a video system and that it's just Falwell ?
O,"I mean , he has to see I'm not quite sure looked at these justices because like Sonia Sotomayor does not want to wash her hair ."
O,She's on a streak .
O,She's not going to do it .
O,And I barely did mine for you guys .
O,"All right , Grant ."
O,Here is your last quote .
O,They're taking the town back .
O,It's now theirs .
O,That was a man in Wales noticing that what are now taking over are empty streets and towns .
O,All the wild animals .
O,"Yes , all the animals ."
O,That's exactly right .
O,"Since people are being forced to stay home , the animals have come out ."
O,"Goats were walking down the street in Wales , Wales walking down the street and goats at Yosemite ."
O,All the bears have come out and Yellowstone is crawling with leather daddies .
O,That would be .
O,"Oh , my God , you guys ."
O,"It turns out like we're like basically my old roommate , Derek , who left a bunch of dirty dishes and like ."
O,Water all over the apartment .
O,"And then when he finally moved out , the apartment was clean like we are ."
O,That roommates were there .
O,Etc. .
O,Where the global derrick you go .
O,There is one group of animals that are not happy .
O,And that is and this is true New York City rats .
O,They're apparently forming armies and battling each other because there's not enough garbage to eat now without filthy humans discarding pizza crusts and other garbage .
O,The rats will have to start cooking for themselves .
O,And you thought they were annoying before .
O,Wait till the rats start talking about their sour dough starter .
O,"But if the animals really are taking over , we don't know ."
O,None of us have been outside in three weeks .
O,While we would like to welcome our new audience by replacing our Bluff the Listener game with Hump the listeners leg .
O,"Meanwhile , aides just dogs that hump legs , right ?"
O,"It's not like , oh , I saw a vulture ."
O,I hope so .
O,I would be very fresh .
O,It would be very frightening if a bear were to do that .
O,Bill had a grant do on our quiz .
O,Grant did well enough to go back to the CDC and protective .
O,"So if they discover a vaccine grant , please call me Grant , the three of you so much ."
O,I really appreciate you joining us and thanks for the good work you do at the CDC .
O,Keeping those guys safe .
O,"Thank you , sir ."
O,Thank you .
O,And now we turn to public service with a segment we call Wash Your Hands with Bill because singing Happy Birthday to yourself twice just doesn't cut it .
O,"Now , this week , Bill KURTIS has brought along a friend to help him out ."
O,"It is Josh Canter , the official organist of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park ."
O,"Welcome to Wait , Wait , Josh ."
O,"Thanks for having me , Peter ."
O,"So a lot of people are wondering , what does a baseball stadium organist do when there's no baseball ?"
O,Do you do you play a like you play organ to accompany chores around the house ?
O,"If there's no game to play plan , I I still play anyway ."
O,But what some friends advise me to do was to just hit the go button on the livestream while I do it .
O,And I've been doing that every day since the baseball season was supposed to have started three weeks ago .
O,And it's raising money for local food banks in the process .
O,So you're doing daily live stream concerts from your house .
O,Yes .
O,And taking requests on a live chat .
O,What is the strangest thing that you've been asked so far to play on your organ ?
O,"I mean , I do get a variety of strange things in order on when someone will want to hear like a free jazz , you know , like an Ornette Coleman kind of thing ."
O,The strangest requests are not the ones that are .
O,It's not the song itself .
O,It's the story behind the songs .
O,"Or someone will say , I just got engaged in our song is is God Only Knows by the Beach Boys ."
O,Could you play for us ?
O,And it's like a it's a beautiful song .
O,Be the very first lyric of the song is I May Not Always Love You .
O,"And that's what you're asking me to play to your you know , to your new fiancee ."
O,"But sure , I'll play it if that's what you really want ."
O,Lutely .
O,"Well , Josh , we have asked you here , of course , to help with Bill as he helps America wash their hands ."
O,"So Bill and Josh , take it away ."
O,"Here we go , Josh ."
O,"One , two , three ."
O,Take me to the ball game .
O,Take me right to the sink .
O,Buy me some anti-bacterial gel .
O,I'll follow that up with has squared her role .
O,"Its root , root , root with my maths on ."
O,"Please don't sit next to me for it's one , two ."
O,"Three , four , five , six feet away ."
O,New ball game .
O,A big thing is horrible .
O,"You right back to Fenway , doesn't it , Josh ?"
O,Nothing .
O,Josh Kanter is the organist at Fenway Park and for the Boston Red Sox and he is doing a free organ concert every day .
O,"Josh , how did people find that seventh inning stretch 20/20 on Facebook ?"
O,"Josh , thank you so much ."
O,All right .
O,"Thanks , everybody ."

O,Say Paul is one of my very favorite places .
O,What do you do there ?
O,I work with middle schoolers who qualify for special ed service .
O,"Oh , you are a saint ."
O,"Doubly so , sir , because just just teaching middle school to me is an amazing act of service ."
O,How are you spending your time since classes are canceled ?
O,"Well , we do distance learning , but they're also sending some people to man daycare for kids whose parents work in health care ."

O,"David , it is very nice to have you with us ."
O,You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction .

O,"Celebrity parents , they're just like us ."
O,Sure .
O,It seems like celebrity parents have it all figured out .
O,Alec Baldwin .
O,Joan Crawford .
O,Bill Cosby .
O,"But famous moms and dads , they can make mistakes , too ."
O,Our panelists are going to tell you about a celebrity parenting error .
O,Pick the one who's telling the truth and you'll win our prize .
O,The wait waiter of your choice and your voicemail .
O,"You ready to play , David ?"
O,I am .
O,All right .
O,"First , let's hear from Adam FELBER ."
O,First graders enrolled in Brooklyn's Cavendish School were treated to an unexpected visitor in their virtual Xoom classroom this week when one of the student's dads accidentally showed up in the background and commenced an exercise routine in his underwear as a special bonus .
O,That dad was beloved actor Paul Giamatti .
O,"Yes , things went sideways for 7 year old Ashley GMAT when , unbeknownst to her , her famous dad spread out a map in the clearly visible next room and began stretching ."
O,Clad only in a pair of boxer shorts and an undershirt .
O,"Soon , children were laughing and parents were flocking into view to see what one onlooker described as a bizarre routine that seemed to be part yoga , part taichi and part modern dance ."
O,"By the end , said one Cavendish mom ."
O,"There were a series of deep bends and gyrations better suited for an exotic dance floor , certainly not for a first grade classroom ."
O,"It was around this time that young Ashley turned around , gasped in horror and shouted , Dad , we can all see you ."
O,"Giamatti has already apologized to his fellow parents , citing the difficulties of family sheltering in place ."
O,"Embarrassed , he said , Please , guys ."
O,I was in Big Momma's House .
O,"But Ashley , she may need therapy ."
O,Paul Giamatti doing exercises in his underwear behind his very embarrassed daughter during asume class .
O,Your next story of a mommy mistake comes from Negin Farsad .
O,Kelly Clarkson is a fun mom .
O,"She sings , obviously , but she celebrates every occasion with a kind of gusto you would expect from the from Justin to Kelly Star and her kid River ."
O,Losing his first tooth was no exception .
O,"The night that rivers' first tooth fell , he dutifully put it under his pillow and drifted to sleep ."
O,"Clarkson brought in makeup and costume artists to make her into the tooth fairies magical assistant , complete with a frilly gown , wings , glitter and an impressive wand ."
O,She hired a prop master to beam glowing purple light on his bed and set up a rig that enabled Clarkson to literally float into Rivers bedroom .
O,"She gently wakes her kid up to tell him the tooth fairy is about to arrive , which he decided to do randomly in a British accent ."
O,Atabay never woke up totally confused and punches his mother in the face .
O,She falls back and screams in a perfect C-sharp .
O,"Of course , her wings get caught on the rig , which topples onto a lamp , causing a small fire ."
O,"In the meantime , the kid is crying wildly , runs into the kitchen and dials 9-1-1 , telling them that a lady with waves is trying to steal me and set fire to our house ."
O,"Police arrived to find a frazzled Kelly Clarkson with soot on her face in burnt assistant tooth fairy regalia , a frightened makeup person , costume designer and prop master , and a six year old kid in hysterics ."
O,"Of course , Bellaire police are used to breaking up celebrity parties , as one cop put it ."
O,"You wouldn't believe the costume fetish celebs have , but there's usually a lot of drugs and sometimes an exotic animal ."
O,Clarkson Explain what happened .
O,Thank the cops and smiled .
O,That's when everyone noticed Kelly Clarkson is missing a tooth because her son had punched it out .
O,Kelly Clarkson goes a little bit too far in acting out the role of the .
O,Ferry for her son .
O,And your last story of a problematic parent comes from Peter GROSZ .
O,Comedian Amy Schumer and her husband Chris Fisher are the proud parents of a beautiful 11 month old baby boy named Jean David Fisher .
O,But that wasn't always the little guy's name .
O,"Schumer revealed on her podcast this week that she changed her son's name after a friend pointed out that the original name , the name they put on his birth certificate last May , might have earned the boy considerable scorn as he reached adolescence ."
O,"Little Jean's original middle name , Attell , after comedian and friend David Telle meant that his first two names would be Jean Attell , which sounds more than a little bit like the word genital ."
O,Maybe not that much to use .
O,Sophisticated .
O,NPR listener .
O,But to the mercilus sixth grade boys and little jian's future .
O,"It would have been a veritable gold mine , a teasing perfect storm on par with being the classmate of a kid named Mike Rauch or Maya Butz or Anita Weener ."
O,"Schumer weighed many options after realizing her oversight , including changing the boy's name to the baby , formerly known as Gina @tell , but then realized she could just change his middle name to David ."
O,So that was that .
O,"While this was the first recorded celebrity baby name change , many celebrities , of course , alter their own birthdays before becoming famous ."
O,Kari Grant was born .
O,Archibald Leach .
O,Mel Brooks was born .
O,Melvin Kaminsky .
O,Queen Latifah was born Princess Latifa .
O,"Benedict Cumberbatch was born Benzedrine , cummerbund and rapper ."
O,Baby was actually born to baby and just forgot to change his name to do grown up .
O,All right .
O,"Here , David , are your choices from Adam FELBER was apology imadi broadcasting his exercise routine in his underwear to his daughter's entire class via video link from Negin Farsad ."
O,Kelly Clarkson trying to do a wonderful thing for her son when he lost a tooth and instead losing a tooth herself .
O,"Or from Peter GROSZ , Amy Schumer and her husband realizing that the name they gave their beloved first child sounds a little bit too much like the word genitalia ."
O,Which of these was the real story of a celebrity parenting mistake ?
O,"They all seem pretty unbelievable , but I think I'm going to have to go with Jeanne Attell , Jeanne Attell , the former name of Amy Schumer's baby ."
O,"Well , to find out the correct answer ."
O,"Well , please listen to this ."
O,It was Jean Attell Fisher .
O,But we realized that we by accident named our son Janet Doll .
O,That was Amy Schumer .
O,She was on her own .
O,What guys ?
O,Three girls .
O,"One , Keith ."
O,"Congratulations , David ."
O,You got it right .
O,You've earned a point for Peter GROSZ .
O,You've won our prize .
O,And Amy Schumer has now renamed her baby after you .
O,"David , thank you so much for playing ."
O,And thank you for every single thing that you do .
O,They're all important and amazing .
O,Thank you so much .
O,Thanks .
O,Bye .
O,Bye bye .
O,You call .
O,"And now the game where we ask people who've done remarkable things to do , just one more ."
O,"Tom Hanks has had an amazing career with his many blockbuster films , best selling books to Oscars ."
O,"And of course , I think the pinnacle of his career hosting this show once ."
O,"Well , we heard he just got over a bad cold ."
O,We thought he'd be time to invite him back .
O,"Tom Hanks , welcome back to Wait , Wait ."
O,It's good to be back .
O,The source of the finest reviews of my career .
O,"Well , actually , this is the first time you've been on the show since you did that about three years ago and did , in fact , people reach out to you because they reached out to me and they basically said , Peter , when are you leaving again ?"
O,We'll have those things in our checkered careers .
O,Don't we go on Netflix and look for Bonfire of the Vanities .
O,"And , you know , I have to ask on behalf of a I think a concerned globe , how are you feeling , Tom Hanks ?"
O,"We are just fine , dandy ."
O,We had all of the flu like symptoms .
O,My wife Rita was a little worse off than me .
O,She had a very high temperature and we were isolated so that we would not give it to any one else .
O,Right .
O,"Now that you've had it , are you supposedly like immune , your superheroes , you can walk amongst us and be immune or is that just nonsense ?"
O,"Well , a lot of the question is , is what now ?"
O,"You know , what do we do now ?"
O,Is it something we can do ?
O,"And in fact , we just found out that we do carry the antibodies ."
O,"Oh , wait ."
O,So can we harvest your body ?
O,Can we harvest your bliss ?
O,Have you been approached ?
O,"We we've not only been approached , we have said , do you want our blood ?"
O,Can we give plasma ?
O,"And in fact , we will be giving it now to the places that hope to work on what I would like to call the Тhank scene ."
O,"Yes , there could be no better ending to this international atrophy ."
O,If the cure turns out to be the blood of Tom would not be .
O,I've always thought it would do it some good .
O,I'm not I'm not trying to hog it with a copy .
O,Right .
O,"Or , you know , I'm not going to the patent office ."
O,"You thought he was Jimmy Stewart , but he's also Jonas ."
O,So .
O,"Tom , let me ask you the obvious Hollywood question ."
O,"If there is a sequel , would you consider being in COVA 20 ?"
O,"Yes , I would ."
O,I would answer all the questions left unanswered by Kogut 19 .
O,"And by the way , how many franchises do you have to go on that long ?"
O,"James Bond , The Fast and the Furious and the Colvard series ."
O,"And I say for all of America , can there just be one of these ?"
O,"We love you , Tom ."
O,I do not want to see the second one .
O,You hosted Saturday Night Live .
O,You sort of ushered that show back into production in the middle of all this .
O,And a question arose that I have seen coursing through social media .
O,And I can pose it to you now .
O,Tom Hanks .
O,Was that your real kitchen ?
O,"No , that was my abandoned office ."
O,That is 10 minutes away from my home .
O,"Can I ask you , what do you have against your own kitchen that you went into the kitchen ?"
O,"What you're seeing down there truly is my taste in declaration , not my wife's taste ."
O,"Yes , it is me , baby ."
O,That is that is my big masculine man .
O,Okay .
O,And you should have been able to tell by the fabulous one button only cappuccino espresso maker that was back bell over my left hand .
O,Dark mahogany cabinets .
O,Right .
O,Sort of a red .
O,That is my crib .
O,And I am I am proud of it .
O,What was funny was so many people like that is no way .
O,That is like an A-list movie stars kitchen .
O,So could you for the just for the benefit .
O,Those people lie to America about what your real kitchen is like .
O,My real kitchen .
O,I assume it looks like the dining hall and hogwash .
O,"No , no ."
O,It has the ratchet to the kitchen with all those lights .
O,I can go all .
O,Do you know ?
O,Have you seen Downton Abbey ?
O,All those people that were downstairs making bread and stuff like that ?
O,"Mrs Patmore , I'm not sure what their names are ."
O,"I don't know how long they've been working for us , but they are really busy down there ."
O,"And if I had done SNL over their shoulders , it wouldn't have had the same impact ."
O,What is your life like during lockdown ?
O,"Are you doing the same as the rest of us just in your house , reading books , spending your time , taking a zoo ?"
O,I find a certain something different has happened about every 20 minutes I've done the Marie Kondo izing of much of my life .
O,I must say I found this microphone .
O,That's one thing I didn't realize .
O,I had this microphone .
O,Some lucky us .
O,"It was in the original box , so I pulled it out ."
O,"But I got to say , if I win one hand of solitaire , I immediately try to see if I get two in a row ."
O,So I'm busy .
O,I am really very busy .
O,And .
O,"Yeah , well , Tom Hanks , it is such a pleasure to talk to you every single time we get to do it ."
O,But there are rules .
O,So this time we have asked you here to play a game we're calling .
O,It's a terrible day in the neighborhood .
O,Your most recent film to come out was a beautiful day in the neighborhood .
O,"You played Mister Rogers , the ."
O,"Nicest neighbor ever , so we thought we'd ask you about some of the worst neighbors ever ."
O,"Answer two out of three correctly and you'll win a prize for one of our listeners , the voice of anyone they may choose on their voicemail ."
O,"Well , I was actually hoping the prize would be they get to substitute host wait , wait ."
O,Don't tell me .
O,"Once again , just because you won that once doesn't mean we let a bill ."
O,Who is Tom Hanks playing for today ?
O,"Diana come Selman of Fort Worth , Texas ."
O,All right .
O,"You know , do Miss Diana , you've been on both sides ."
O,Here we go .
O,"You might be excited if your neighbor won the lottery , but not the neighbors of a British man who won 10 million pounds in 2003 and then did what with the money ?"
O,Was it A he bought the house next door and created Britain's first rat sanctuary and petting zoo B .
O,He added an additional 15 stories onto his house where C turned his yard into a demolition derby racetrack .

O,That the neighbor's cat really seemed not to enjoy being dressed up every day with a hat for a kitty Tea Party or see that her neighbor's dog really seemed to look and act like a person in a dog suit .
O,These are far too possible .
O,Each one of them .
O,"Parrot , cat or dog ."
O,Yes .
O,Those are the three pets .
O,"You've heard the story of the parrot who did swear far too much and insulted its owner until in anger , the owner grabbed the parrot and shoved it into his freezer above his refrigerator ."
O,"And then when leaving in there for a few minutes , he opened the door ."
O,"And the parrot was very contrite and said , I want to apologize ."
O,My my language was I should not have used it .
O,It was rude of me .
O,And I hope you can forgive me .
O,"And then the parrot said , and by the way , just what did the chicken do in honor of that joke ?"
O,I'm going to I'm going to vote for the foul mouth .
O,You're exactly right .
O,That's it .
O,That's the one .
O,The neighbor claimed that the parrot was shouting obscenities in Spanish .
O,The parrots owner said the parrot doesn't even know Spanish .
O,OK .
O,All right .

O,"B , he got some paint and he just painted the words ."
O,"Look , Bob , I've painted my fence on the ugly old wood or C he tore down the fence and put up five concrete highway barriers ."
O,Who would complain about 70 year old nudists ?

O,Scientists in France have found a fifty thousand year old piece of string .
