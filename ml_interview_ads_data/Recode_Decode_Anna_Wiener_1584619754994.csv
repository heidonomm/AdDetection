O,"Hi , I'm Kara Swisher , editor at large of Recode ."
O,You may know me as someone who loves the culture in Silicon Valley almost as much as I love the culture at Mar a Lago .
O,"But in my spare time , I'm just a reporter and you're listening to Ricoh decode a podcast about power change and the people you need to know around tech and beyond ."
O,We're part of the VOX Media Podcast Network .
O,"And by the way , Eric , that was an excellent one today for this guest ."
O,"Today in the red chair is Anna Weener , a contributing writer to The New Yorker who covers Silicon Valley startup culture and technology ."
O,She's also author of a new book that's getting a lot of great reviews called Uncanny Valley A Memoir .
O,"Anna , welcome to Ricoh Decode ."
O,"Thank you , Karen ."
O,"So we were enhanced by Casey Newton , who just loves you and loves what you did with your book and everything else about what you do ."
O,But it's such a good introduction by Casey .
O,Explain to people who you are .
O,You're getting amazing reviews for this book .
O,It's a memoir of Silicon Valley .
O,"There's been a lot of memoirs , a lot of people talking about their time here ."
O,And this one's really sticking out .
O,It's interesting because it's not something people haven't written about .
O,So let's talk a little bit about the book itself and how you decided to write it .
O,And then we're going to get into the book itself and then topics around it .
O,Tell your story of how you got here and how you decided to write this story .
O,So I came here in 2013 .
O,"I had been working in book publishing in New York , and I briefly joined an e-book startup there and then came out here to work for a data analytics startup ."
O,"And mostly what brought me here was just the desire for a future , a sense of momentum , a sense of belonging ."
O,I was a very low level employee .
O,I came out here to do a customer support job .
O,"But I mostly I wanted to feel having graduated directly into a recession in 2009 , that I had some foothold in in the future and that there was some sense of momentum were publishing ."
O,Let's go back to that .
O,"So you were in a profession that a lot of people , lot of smart young people get into the idea ."
O,"But housing , which is sort of on its last legs , kind of the concept that it's not on its last legs , but the concept is that it's the past and the way people publish books ."
O,But it used to be sort of the profession .
O,"Smart , intellectual people wanted to get into or die , get getting despite the low pay , despite this sort of slow crawl up the ladder there ."
O,"So you were you moved into that profession , presumably because ."
O,That's what you liked ?
O,Correct .
O,"Yeah , it seemed appealing to me to be working with books , it's one of I sort of ."
O,"Tend to have a blind spot to things that might be interesting to me , I've not married my interests with my work often , so ."
O,Yeah .
O,"It wasn't the prestige , actually ."
O,I know what you're talking about .
O,Sort of like a dimension of prestige with these older industries in New York .
O,It just was exciting to me that I could be working on a product that I really cared about .
O,You cared about ?
O,Okay .
O,So what made you shift from that with the idea ?
O,"Now , e-book startups at the time were ."
O,What year was this ?
O,That .
O,So I started thinking about leaving in 2012 .
O,"And I was sort of looking around and , you know , Amazon just casts a shadow over the entire industry ."
O,And it seems like there wasn't a lot of .
O,"Upward mobility within the industry , I kind of love seeing people who had jobs that I wanted and they were leaving the industry and everything was consolidating , shrinking ."
O,"So I read about this e-book startup that was doing like a Netflix for you book sort of product and thought , oh , I can be useful here ."
O,I have knowledge that might be interesting to them .
O,"And I reached out and I think they were like , oh , this woman's a go getter ."
O,"Yeah , because I wrote an email , you know , it's one of these like long , embarrassing emails ."
O,"And I went on as a three month contractor , sort of to be the person who knew about books ."
O,What did you do there ?
O,Explain what you did .
O,I wrote a lot of e-mails talking about how much I loved books and I did some curating of in-app titles .
O,"But it was mostly it was only in , I guess , Baydar Alfons and one of these ."
O,"So the only people who were using it , I think it was prebate care because Alpha Alpha ."
O,I don't know it .
O,The only people who were using the app were friends and family and investors .
O,So it was a little bit of a gratuitous job .
O,And mostly I was just like an office manager trying to find furniture and ordering FreshDirect .
O,"So , you know , it was a company of three founders , one engineer and me ."
O,"And toward the end of my tenure , they were like , this has been interesting that there really isn't a job for you ."
O,There wasn't even a public product .
O,So they helped me find a job out here at a analytics company .
O,"And at that point , I was already hooked ."
O,"You know , I was like , I love this feeling of a small team ."
O,I love the speed .
O,I love the momentum .
O,There was so much money .
O,"Like , I don't want to discount that factor in my decision ."
O,I was making suddenly $10000 more a year if I had stayed for here .
O,Right .
O,And my first job in tech in Silicon Valley was more than twice my publishing salary .
O,So talk about that .
O,So what made you move out ?
O,Not everybody does that .
O,"So you you would not you were not a technical person , because that's usually how people get here ."
O,They usually have some technical degree or they want to start a company or they want to join Facebook or Google or whatever .
O,It is true that I wanted none of this .
O,Yes .
O,Yeah .
O,I don't know .
O,I felt like I had nothing to lose .
O,It seemed like an adventure .
O,"I sort of had this idea that I would come out here , I'd have this job and customer support for a year ."
O,I'd probably return to New York after that and try to leverage it into a better job in another industry or in tech as well .
O,"But it you know , I was twenty five ."
O,I'd only ever lived in the Tri-State area .
O,So it felt like an adventure to me .
O,And what was your vision of Silicon Valley before you came out ?
O,"Because this was the beginning of the end of , you know , everything was sort of up into the right ."
O,There's a lot of fanboys .
O,These people were celebrated as heroes .
O,That it started to shift not long after you started working in the sector .
O,Yeah .
O,I was pretty oblivious to that .
O,"I have to say , I think that I felt I treated it or in my mind , it was a small business ."
O,"You know , it was a company that was in this broader ecosystem that I didn't totally pay attention to or really understand ."
O,"But , you know , I went out and I met the people who worked there and they were all really smart and they were all kind of like me ."
O,"You know , a lot of people with liberal arts backgrounds who have found their way into this universe and ."
O,"I got I mean , what what drew me here is what has kept me here , which is the culture and it's what keeps me writing about it ."
O,I find it fascinating .
O,It's full of human drama and psychological insight .
O,"So , you know , I definitely I'm not ."
O,"And although programming background , I didn't even like do MySpace as a kid ."
O,"So , yeah , I think you're talking about it from a sociological perspective ."
O,That's how what you're how you're approaching it .
O,Like it doesn't really matter that you don't know how tech works necessarily .
O,And I reject the classification of non-technical .
O,"I think if you're working in a startup , you have to be technical ."
O,I think a lot of end users are technical .
O,Just because you're not writing code every day doesn't necessarily discount you from that category .
O,All right .
O,So talk about your impressions when you first got here .
O,This book does a really good job of sort of you're coming into .
O,"It's almost like stranger in a strange land , like you get here and you ."
O,What did you expect versus what happened ?
O,"And talk a little bit about sort of your initial thoughts and how they gel , because you did try very hard to fit in ."
O,You sort of embraced the culture of of tech .
O,I guess there is a certain San Francisco culture of tech that's different than other places .
O,Yeah .
O,And some of it is value based and some of it is sort of aesthetic .
O,Right .
O,I think that I really tried on .
O,"Well , I guess I and I indulged in both ."
O,Yes .
O,So it .
O,"Yeah , I mean I moved out here ."
O,I didn't know a ton of people in San Francisco .
O,I was 25 .
O,I was single .
O,I didn't really know that .
O,"If your employee 20 at a startup that's doing really well and growing very quickly , that that's going to be your whole life ."
O,"Like , I sort of had this vague idea that maybe I would like do something creative on the side and this would be my day job ."
O,This was my whole life .
O,Yeah .
O,"So for a little while at least until I sort of started to back off of it , but that I didn't anticipate I was the fourth woman out of 20 at the company , actually ."
O,Pretty good ratio .
O,All things considered .
O,Mm hmm .
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , the things that that I would criticize now are actually the things that were really intoxicating at the start with her talk about that , what intoxicated you , the sense of agency that everyone had , the sense that we owned it , this collective responsibility ."
O,"And , you know , if we saw someone wearing our company t shirt in public , this was like an event ."
O,"You know , we would we would share that with each other ."
O,That was so exciting .
O,I don't know .
O,It's just really thrilling to do well .
O,"And I think for me , especially having come from an industry that , you know , felt like we were surrounded by dinosaur hairs or that we were the dine coming from an industry where it felt like everything was falling apart and everything was shrinking to suddenly be making money to have the company be making money ."
O,"It felt like this huge social affirmation , like I suddenly felt like I had utility and value in the world based on this very simple metric , which was money ."
O,Right .
O,"And so , you know , I I I will criticize that now ."
O,"But at the time , you know , it felt it felt amazing to feel valued and to feel like I had a place in the world ."
O,So talk about a sense of agency .
O,"That's a really interesting word to use the idea of agency , because it is one of the factors that moves people in tech ."
O,I often get like yours .
O,You're sort of bumming out our vibe essentially .
O,But this idea of like moving forward at highest speed .
O,"Damn the torpedoes kind of person like personality type that is here is like , don't we can change anything ?"
O,That concept which is still around to this day and we should be the ones to change .
O,"Yes , exactly ."
O,Yeah .
O,Why you .
O,"But of course , it's us ."
O,So talk a little about that idea when you get here .
O,It is very intoxicating and it's also very inspiring .
O,"And a lot of ways , even though a lot of what's behind it is pretty much bullshit ."
O,Many of the times we talk a little about how that feels to be part of because I think people one of the things you do very well in this book is really you're critical of it and yet not cruel to the concept of what people are trying to do here .
O,It's sort of people .
O,There was a quote and I I think I lost it in this in my thing .
O,My one of my apps didn't work .
O,"But it was the idea that an archive of what in hindsight , this is a story you did in The Guardian ."
O,Just ask what in hindsight is very obvious ways to navigate work situations that were overly complex because I didn't know how to be as a person .
O,So they're creating these cultures in this culture and that was a big part of it .
O,So talk a little bit about that .
O,What what's intoxicating ?
O,"That being a part of that group , I think this feeling that your contributions matter in book publishing , by contrast , is pretty sclerotic industry and it's very analog and it's in its way ."
O,And there's a reason for that .
O,"Actually , I mean , it takes a long time to put a book together for a reason ."
O,"And you can usually tell when a book has been written hastily or when it's been crashed , you know , and it's been pushed out for publication early ."
O,"I mean , I think for me , I was working in customer support , so I was directly engage with the people who were using our product and they loved it ."
O,And that I just can't I can't overemphasize how good that feels .
O,"And you're surrounded by people who are smart and motivated and everyone's committed to this project and you're being rewarded for it in many different ways , financially , socially ."
O,"And we would have these like customer events , I think , monthly , where there'd be some sort of presentation about analytics and then mingling and people would come up and you felt like sort of like you had street cred working at this company ."
O,People were impressed by your status in the ecosystem .
O,So I don't know .
O,"I think for me , I was just a social affirmation ."
O,"And then inside the company , this feeling that if you could prove that you could do something , you could leverage that into a job ."
O,"That actually didn't happen for me , even though I was I I sort of experience the flip side of that , which is that you do all sorts of work outside of your job description and are not compensated for that or given any sort of title , whatever ."
O,"Because you're down in my in our case , the company had this phrase down for the cause ."
O,"So , I mean , that was a really great speech ."
O,"Please have those of these companies , the FTC ."
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,Down for the cause .
O,"Just meant , you know , committing yourself to the company , doing whatever it took to get the company moving forward ."
O,"So for me to be specific about it , I was working customer support then and customer success and was doing a lot of copywriting because we didn't have a full fully fledged marketing department ."
O,And it was getting to the point where was it a significant workload ?
O,And I asked if I could have a raise or a title promotion to reflect that .
O,And I was told that I was doing it because I cared .
O,And I did really care .
O,And that is why I was doing it .
O,All right .
O,I was also doing X .
O,I want to keep my job .
O,All right .
O,But I .
O,"Then there was a discussion about how I could become the copywriter , but I would be paid less than a customer support representative ."
O,"So to me , it's like you you kind of have these ideals and you have this culture that feels really intoxicating and then you run up against the realities of this being a business ."
O,I actually think that Silicon Valley could be much improved if everyone would just admit that what they're doing is running businesses .
O,Right .
O,Let's all just be really straightforward about that .
O,Right .
O,And I'm curious if that ties into what you were saying earlier about the culture changing .
O,Maybe people are just being more honest .
O,"No , I don't think they are ."
O,I don't think they are .
O,And I think they're being forced to do so .
O,I think that's what's happening here .
O,"And I think what's really , you know , the concept of my very first article over The Wall Street Journal was on their stupid phrases like a lot of their like down for the cause is just another one of the many , many ."
O,"And you go over them , a bunch of the other ones , you oh , forget I don't remember ."
O,"It was 20 years ago like they had all these two things was one , they're dumb phrases and they're dumb titles for themselves ."
O,Like I think Jerry Yang was chief Yahoo !
O,They all had chief experience officer chief .
O,"They just if you could find this story 20 years ago , but they all gave him idiot titles for what they were doing at their companies as if this was a playground versus a company ."
O,And I made fun of it .
O,"And then the same thing with the clothing , like how they downplay their wealth by wearing , you know , really juvenile cloak guru animals essentially is what I think I call them at the time ."
O,And so it was real .
O,"It was super interesting , this constant juvenile ization of what they're doing or silliness to it when in fact they had real world impact ."
O,"I think it didn't come into four until there was real world impact , just like Facebook , where social media with Trump with everything else and then the chickens come home to roost , essentially ."
O,And so I think that was to me what I liked about this book was all the phrases .
O,"I mean , you have a whole bunch of them here that I hadn't heard , like verballing ."
O,Is that right ?
O,Go through a couple of them .
O,"Well , that's a company name ."
O,Yeah .
O,Over .
O,I'm sorry .
O,Talk about the word .
O,The words down for the count was down for the cause .
O,"Down for the cat is he reminds me of TCB taking care of business , which was Elvis's big phrase ."
O,I don't know if you know that Elvis used to pass out that similar thing .
O,"Talk a little bit about why the use of phrase , because you talk about that a lot ."
O,The use of phrases in sort of a cult based culture really is what you're what you're talking about .
O,That's interesting .
O,"I mean , for me , I'm just I'm someone who pays attention to language ."
O,"And so when I see it sort of contorted and warped in this way , I find it very amusing , but also very strange ."
O,And I think part of it is if you have .
O,A new vocabulary for something quite traditional sort of .
O,"It's just marketing , it's just repackaging it as novel or ."
O,I don't know .
O,Innovative in some way .
O,Right .
O,So I think that that's happening on the language level in the same way that it's happening on a business level .
O,Right .
O,"Like all of these DTC companies , startups are really invested in storytelling and branding ."
O,And that's sort of what they're selling actually more than any particularly unique product .
O,I seeing about this on the walk over because I was thinking about soft skills and hard skills and just how good tech is at storytelling .
O,Even though it's so dismissive of soft skills and I would say soft storytelling is a soft skill .
O,"Yeah , but I think that the language has something to do with that ."
O,That's just my hypothesis .
O,"It's an untested , unproven ."
O,"Well , it's language of telling ."
O,They're creating their own narrative .
O,"I think that's what you're talking about , is how to create a narrative that isn't true , even even to the fact that how these companies were founded ."
O,"They later put they apply narratives to things that were not did not have such a romantic beginning or , you know , Facebook was created in response to the Iraq war fighting ."
O,"I mean , get out ."
O,I think for me was almost insulting about that .
O,"It's like Mark , we're paying attention to it , right ?"
O,I think we're at .
O,We're not watching .
O,"Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
O,It's brazen .
O,It says that actually said a lot .
O,I don't know at that particular revisionist history or attempt at revisionist history said a lot to me about .
O,About narrative but also just about that company .
O,I don't .
O,I'm Carol .
O,I think Woods .
O,I like about your book is the constant .
O,I think you point out would it with constant lying to themselves .
O,"One of the things I always think about is , oh , when I was a reporter , you often like one of the people lying to me about today , like what's the what's the daily lie that I have to , like , uncover and point out is a lie ."
O,And one of the things that I find more helpful is what are they lying themselves about ?
O,And so that would happens in Silicon Valley .
O,Is this .
O,I remember getting here and having to go .
O,I went to a company and it was excite at the time .
O,"And the founders , they had slides between the floors like children's slides , you know , to get them from one floor to the other , like the sads zip line ."
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,"Yes , exactly ."
O,"They had a plan , you write , and they had all those those sticks , those stupid sticks that you write about ."
O,Sticks .
O,Yeah .
O,Whatever .
O,"I wouldn't get on those but I remember them saying , oh slide down the slide ."
O,Everybody does .
O,And I go I don't .
O,I'm an adult .
O,I don't say hi down slides .
O,I didn't like them when I was eight .
O,My guide care .
O,I just like the thought of trying to make you have fun and in an office .
O,Makes me want to die .
O,Like I just can't imagine ever trying to convince you into like doing an adult scavenger hunt .
O,No .
O,I pity the person who tried .
O,They've tried one of the ones that was the Zen one .
O,What was the Zen one ?
O,"Zen , whatever it was ."
O,They made everyone take off their shoes .
O,"When you get these people out of their little soft slippers , their slippers and socks and they're like , you know , take off your shoes ."
O,"And I'm like , I'm not taking off my shoe ."
O,Come on .
O,That's sweet .
O,That's nice .
O,"No , it's not sweet ."
O,I don't wanna take off my fucking shoes .
O,I don't wear my shoes and I walk through places .
O,And it was so fine .
O,"They're like , put your shoes here ."
O,"I'm like , I'm not leaving my shoes here in front with everyone to look at my shoes ."
O,I'm gonna wear my shoes and walk through your place .
O,And I don't .
O,"Is there something that you have made of , as you know , is the is that are the flaws made of tiny little like small makes that I have to be able to walk on them anyways ?"
O,Very interesting .
O,Get we're talking Hannah .
O,We know she's written a book called Uncanny Valley .
O,When we get back when we talk about why she's calling it and Candy Valley and also do some readings from the book .

O,We're here with Anna Weener .
O,She's the author of Uncanny Valley In .
O,Why did you call it Uncanny Valley ?
O,What was the what was the thinking behind it ?
O,Uncanny Valley is a phrase that I stole from robotics .
O,It describes a sort of psychological experience when humans encounter .
O,"It's specific to robotics , a humanoid robot ."
O,"And as the robot becomes more realistic or exhibits human qualities , there's an increase in affinity for that object ."
O,"And then as it starts to become more realistic , but not quite real ."
O,Right .
O,There's a in .
O,Right .
O,So it's a feeling of of uneasiness .
O,"I thought I'm looking for not disassociation , but revulsion and horror is wrong here ."
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,So this feeling that as it approaches for real sickness .
O,So that's what happened to you ?
O,That's what happened to you .
O,"Yeah , I felt that that was a appropriate analogy ."
O,So tell me how that happened .
O,"Because I mean , I think I think the issue is when you're seeing all these false narratives and all these weird phrases and sort of the called ishness , if you're the one person , it goes , wait a minute , something's wrong here is very hard to do in this culture of this rah-rah where the t shirt love the company , do group exercises and things like that ."
O,Any any number of things that they employ in Silicon Valley to keep people sort of within the bubble .
O,They live in .
O,Yeah .
O,And I am someone who fully participated in that and enjoyed it .
O,"You know , with great pleasure ."
O,"I was like the person at the company who's saying , let's have yoga classes in the office ."
O,"Here I am , someone who would love to like to downward facing dog ."
O,Yeah .
O,I just I just want to be doing this two feet from my desk .
O,We did yoga .
O,It wasn't anyway .
O,Does matter .
O,When did it turn for you ?
O,Talk about turning .
O,I'd like you to read a section from the book .
O,I think one of the moments I read in it that it sort of started to shift .
O,Sure .
O,Yeah .
O,"If something's too good to be true , it's usually too good to be true ."
O,I will read this .
O,Meet the section about a meeting that we had one morning .
O,A meeting was dropped mysteriously onto our calendars .
O,"The last time this happened , we were given forms that asked us to rate various values on a scale of one to five , our desire to lead a team , the importance of work life balance ."
O,I gave both things before and was told I didn't want them enough .
O,At the designated time we shuffled into a conference room shrugging .
O,The conference room had a million dollar view of downtown San Francisco .
O,But we kept the shades down across the street .
O,A bucket drummer banged out an irregular heartbeat .
O,"We sat in a row back to the window , laptops open ."
O,I looked around the room and felt a wave of affection for these men .
O,The small group of misfits who were the only people who understood the backbone to my new life .
O,"On the other side of the table , the solutions manager paced back and forth ."
O,But he was smiling .
O,"He asked us to write down the names of the five smartest people we knew , and my co-workers dutifully obliged ."
O,"Smart in exactly what way , I wondered ."
O,Capping and uncapping my pen is not accustomed to stack ranking my friends by intelligence .
O,"I wrote five names down a sculptor , a writer , a physicist , two graduate students ."
O,I looked at the list and thought about how much I missed them .
O,How about I'd been at returning phone calls and emails ?
O,I wondered how I'd stop making time for the things and people I held dear .
O,I felt blood rushed to my cheeks .
O,OK .
O,The solutions manager said .
O,"Now tell me , why don't they work here ?"
O,So why don't they work there ?
O,They don't want to work in TAG .
O,"Yeah , they're they're smart people who have interests in the world and they're not motivated by the same things that I was motivated by ."
O,They're more confident in their interest or they are .
O,"You know , don't don't need to get their value from a salary ."
O,"So , I mean , I think for me that that scene or that situation really spoke to the hubris and the arrogance of this industry ."
O,Yeah .
O,And .
O,"This idea that if that the sort of most morally superior best contribution you can make to society is working at a startup , in this case a data analytics startup like , I think that that's one of the small things that's hard to happen that made me think about the end game like what am I actually doing this for ?"
O,"The individual returns were wonderful , right ?"
O,I was making plenty of money and it felt affirming while Stuffies talked about the made me sound like an ad for the industry .
O,"But at the end of the day , I wasn't quite sure that the project that I was advancing was one that I needed to be participating in , let alone one that needed to exist in its current form at all , by which I mean unregulated and a little bit reckless ."
O,And so we're gonna get to what's gonna happen to this .
O,"But talk about this idea of where the he was comes from , because there's you know , you also discuss sexual harassment , all kinds of issues that comes with it ."
O,Where does that come from ?
O,Where where do you imagine ?
O,How did it get created from your perspective ?
O,You talk about that a lot .
O,How did it come to this ?
O,"Like , where does the confidence ."
O,Right .
O,"I mean , there's so many different ways to answer that question ."
O,Right .
O,You can sort of answer it structurally or socially .
O,"I think on the individual level , my sense of it is that here are people who have largely for structural reasons , been catapulted to positions of great power , who have caught a lot of concentrated wealth themselves or around them ."
O,"And many of these men who were running companies in Silicon Valley , at least in the startup world , it's their first job or one of their first jobs ."
O,They Mark Zuckerberg's first job .
O,Think about it .
O,"Oh , I know ."
O,I think about it all the time .
O,And I've worked for people like this .
O,And they've not they have no work experience .
O,"They're learning how to be an executive with very little work or world experience , honestly ."
O,"At the same time that they're coming of age and because of the culture here and I would actually love while I have you to like get your perspective on v.c culture , which is like one of the more interesting parts of this world to me , largely like why are they always on the Internet talking and giving advice to people who aren't asking for it ?"
O,"But I I think that these people are surrounded by other men , largely men who are talking them up , telling them they're brilliant , telling them that if they're making mistakes , it's not their fault , telling them that critics are just haters ."
O,"I think that it's really what people people often talk about or tout the like , optimism and community of Silicon Valley ."
O,And everyone's so supportive .
O,But I think that that can be insulating and that can lead to this feeling of both entitlement and defensiveness .
O,"I mean , I think that you have this like underdog narrative that people are so unwilling to relinquish ."
O,"And it's right now , I think it's sort of crystallizing into a sense of victimhood that I think is so bizarre ."
O,It's like a completely divorced from any understanding of power .
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,100 percent is interesting .
O,I think it has to I think you're kneeling on the head on terms of an enablement culture .
O,It's a really n.g .
O,It's it was farseeing to me is the juvenile ization of men .
O,The total juvenile ization of men .
O,And I think when I first got here and saw all the toys like you will had bouncy balls or jump houses and like things that children play with .
O,Right .
O,The foods were all childlike .
O,"You know , whether it was Froot Loops or peanut butter bars or chicken fingers or whatever it was , the all the food was was not adult food ."
O,"It sounds crazy , but it really was an adult food ."
O,"And I'll never forget , I went to a party for a very well-known person and everything in it was childlike ."
O,"And when you walked into the party , they had footie pajamas or diapers you could wear ."
O,It was it was a cat .
O,This is a party you should not have been invited to .
O,I know .
O,Was it a sex party ?
O,There was not a sex party .
O,"I mean , I would have enjoyed that more , I'm guessing ."
O,"But they so they they it was a baby shower and they they were like , you put on the footie pajamas or you put on the diapers with it with also good glasses ."
O,And they had the things you put in your mouth .
O,Pacifiers .
O,Right .
O,But candy pacifiers as it's a .
O,"No , no ."
O,It is a whole baby .
O,So I went to so many parties like this and I .
O,And then you walked in .
O,There was a bouncy house .
O,"There was food that was all pudding and like baby food , baby kind of food eaten in baby kind of ways ."
O,And there was rollerblading .
O,And and I wouldn't put on the suit .
O,"I wouldn't put on in the outfit , wouldn't take off your shoes and take off my shoes ."
O,"And the person goes , you know , you have to wear pretty pajamas or the diaper ."
O,"And I said , I'm not wearing either ."
O,Like neither of them .
O,"And they're like , you're no fun ."
O,"I go , Yeah , I'm no fun ."
O,That's not me .
O,That's Kara Swisher .
O,No fun .
O,Swisher and Little .
O,I was the only person who didn't do it .
O,And it was except for one person .
O,"Now governor of California , Gavin Newsom ."
O,And he was wearing his suit and wearing his shoes .
O,And I was wearing my clothes .
O,And everybody else was dressed as children around us .
O,"And he goes he goes , How did you get out of it ?"
O,"And I said , Dignity , just play ."
O,"All dignity , I said ."
O,"How did you get out of he goes , I knew you'd be here and you'd totally write about it if I was wearing a diaper or footie pajamas or something ."
O,And it was easy .
O,It was one of dozens of parties like that .
O,"And I remember thinking at the time , there's something deeply wrong with a culture that has to juvenile's themselves ."
O,And I thought there's a couple of things happening here .
O,"One is they had shitty high school experiences where they never got to have fun because they were , you know , they were either geeks or something ."
O,"And that's sort of the old Revenge of the nerds kind of scenario , which I thought was kind of not kind of condescend condescending ."
O,"It wasn't I don't think that was what was happening or that this culture of enormous amounts like creating college campuses or some of like Peter Pan , like Island of Lost Boys kind of thing ."
O,That's really what it was more like .
O,"And again , you know how that ended up ."
O,"They ended up as donkey slaves , essentially ."
O,And so it was I remember thinking like something is wrong here .
O,"And like , jump on the jump began to do this ."
O,"And I was like , no , I am not gay ."
O,"I mean , these are businesses ."
O,"You're just creating things , products that you were selling ."
O,And it was really the pull towards it was really quite fascinating .
O,"And I don't I don't I don't know why , but I do think it has to do with the enablement and telling people that they're very smart when they're not like overindulged children ."
O,"And V , I think are the worst of them , because here you have say and then I'll stop my rant at Uber , for example , you have all the V CS that were like pushing Travis up and saying what a genius he was and telling was a genius and giving him tons of money , which is also a way of loving someone ."
O,Right .
O,And can we unpack ?
O,I don't mean give them money .
O,Like you're so smart .
O,Here's a pile of money .
O,You're so smart .
O,Here's more money is what you do to spoiled children .
O,Essentially not an unselfish thing to do in their case ?
O,"No , not at all , because it's all about what they're going to make ."
O,"On the other hand , and then not worrying about when they start misbehaving ."
O,"And I remember having a discussion with one one of the investors who was like , oh , wait , they're not so bad ."
O,"I'm like , no , no , there's sexual harassment going on there ."
O,There's this going on here .
O,There's this going on here .
O,There's really this is out of control .
O,Why is there liquor in the office ?
O,"It says sexual harassment to me if there's liquor in the eye , you know what I mean ?"
O,"Like , where you gonna end up if people are drinking all day at a company ?"
O,"See , for me , the liquor in the office , at least initially was , oh , I'm a trusted adult ."
O,Mm mm mm mm mm .
O,To me it's a social harassment is coming next .
O,Yeah .
O,You're not wrong .
O,I mean this has been proven .
O,"But you know , starting out I was thinking I'm trusted to have a beer at work because I'm getting my work done because I'm smart and competent and people don't care ."
O,That's the value of my work .
O,It's not the value of your work .
O,"I mean , that helps gets you so far ."
O,"But wait , I would like to return ."
O,Okay .
O,Should you be to the to the child-like workplaces ?
O,Because I have like a much more sympathetic reading of them .
O,All right .
O,"Which now after you've just spoken , I've feels food ."
O,I feel like a fool .
O,All right .
O,Let me hear your sympathetic reading .
O,"I feel like the ridiculousness of these offices , the childishness has something to do with like a physical world to offset the intangible nature of these products where an adult spaces tend not to be tangible in that way ."
O,Right .
O,It's like an adult space has fine art and you can't touch it because it has too much value .
O,So this kid's stuff is to have a sense of play out of physical dimension to this work .
O,"As I'm saying , this feels wrong ."
O,I think you're probably right that it's more about flattery and about this like a reverence .
O,But I guess I just I just have this like probably unfounded compassion for people who are building stuff and committing their lives to things that just don't physically exist and have a lot of power and have a lot of social influence .
O,But .
O,"You know , your code is constantly getting rewritten , is getting a raise ."
O,It's getting replaced .
O,It's you're building stuff that never even gets shipped .
O,And so these spaces to me signify like a desire for groundedness of some sort .
O,My grounded in that way .
O,You can have a comfortable place .
O,You can have like a Pottery Barn kind of atmosphere .
O,You can have whatever .
O,"You can have a comfortable adult space that is not , you know , shabby chic ."
O,I don't know .
O,"And you'll notice that the startups now that are sort of considered more adult , they have like the West home esq furniture ."
O,And like they all have libraries .
O,Yeah .
O,The company library where people employees bring their books .
O,Yeah .
O,"Are terrariums like Amazon , for example ."
O,Who is which is not it .
O,Which is an adult culture .
O,"If you think about it , if you go there , they ."
O,He never indulged in any of that .
O,He was more like tough dad with like you're going to you're going to work on a door .
O,That's what you're going to just buy .
O,Doors because I'm cheap and that's we're gonna do when you're gonna be better for it .
O,"Know-Nothing which is a different kind of dad , right ."
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean dad it's the mean withholding dad , which is I think their culture there ."
O,But getting back to the idea of what they're doing is I think it juvenile's is the culture and therefore you're not responsible for the implications of what you've done .
O,"It's like God , it's like dressing like a scrub when you're a multi multimillionaire ."
O,Right .
O,Which also happens here .
O,Right .
O,Exactly .
O,And I think one of the things that I found was interesting .
O,"Did you say when you think about this , you still are very sympathetic to them ."
O,You feel that they're that it's more like lost boys than .
O,"No , no , no ."
O,I think that the people who have powered responsibility should be accountable for it .
O,Don't push .
O,I lost my narrative .
O,It .
O,I'm sympathetic to them .
O,I think first finding I think that's my outlets like a .
O,"This book's probably representative of my bad personality , which is just like I would like to be analytical and theoretical and like have a spine ."
O,But I'm also a very empathetic person and want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt .
O,Like usually far past the point of what that being appropriate .
O,But I didn't write this book out of contempt .
O,I didn't write it .
O,You can you read some memoirs from Silicon Valley or personal narratives and they're just dripping with contempt .
O,"And to me , that that sort of obscures the structural story ."
O,"So my hope always with this book is husband , that the personal narratives illuminate some structural narrative or not some , but the structural narrative ."
O,"Because a lot of people , the reviewers are talking about it like that ."
O,You've eviscerated these people .
O,"I didn't think you I thought you were very kind , actually , and had some affection for ."
O,It's hard because some of it is really wonderful .
O,"Like the Discover Innovation , discovery , challenging norms is wonderful on some level ."
O,"On the other hand , challenging norms , breaking things , disrupting things is really damaging ."
O,Trump is a good a sort of the version of the Jew analyzation of man taken to the ultimate extreme is just I'm going to break and break and break and then everything's broke .
O,"You and I mean , there's there's there's a flip side to both things ."
O,Yeah .
O,I'm not quite sure what the question .
O,That's what I mean .
O,What I'm wondering is what what what's interesting in the reviews as it's talked about like a eviscerating memoir .
O,Yeah .
O,I don't think that's the case .
O,Do you do that ?
O,Were you trying to do that ?
O,I don't think you were .
O,There was no way you could read it that way .
O,"No , I ."
O,"Actually , I'm really heartened to hear you say that you thought it was kind because , you know , you're harder on yourself than anyone else in this sort of pulling being pulled into it in such a way ."
O,"Well , what kind of person writes a book about their workplace ?"
O,My aim with this book was always to be generous .
O,"I think that for the you know , I experienced probably a much smaller scale than a lot of founders , the sort of intoxication , these seductive narratives ."
O,I can't imagine what it would be like to be twenty nine .
O,And I've been running a company for a decade .
O,That's crazy .
O,"I've lot of sympathy for that person , even if they don't want it ."
O,"I mean , I will also say that I like have this problem of being sympathetic toward people who are like totally happy with their lives ."
O,They don't want it .
O,They're like getaway releases .
O,Using ball of emotion like this is horrifying .
O,Probably also explains why I wasn't a great fit in this industry that that's not really a valued personality type .
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , I think I hope it's an indictment of the system ."
O,"I hope that , you know , the reason I make fun of venture capitalists in the book and NVC Twitter is that it's coming from the top ."
O,Right .
O,"And they'll say , oh , we're just invest ."
O,"You know , we're it's the Alby's who are does it ?"
O,"Sorry , I always confuse the old piece of fun ."
O,"The venture , right ."
O,We don't we're actually just middlemen .
O,But I think that a lot of this culture is created at this sort of like business tier .
O,"And once we can start talking about that and what's wrong there , it you start to see these people , these founders or whomever as sort of expressions of that culture ."
O,As for growth .
O,I have this friend .
O,Have you ever encountered Maura Weigel ?
O,She's brilliant .
O,She's an academic and an a writer and co-founder of Logic magazine .
O,But we were having a conversation once in and she said about all this stuff and .
O,She'd gone to college with Mark Zuckerberg and we're sort of saying how strange it is to see these people ascend who are just normal people too .
O,"And she was like , look , if Mark Zuckerberg didn't exist , the industry would invent him ."
O,And that to me is just like sums it all up .
O,And so that's also why I feel some forgiveness toward people .
O,"It's harder , though , when I think about Mark Zuckerberg ."
O,"I'm like , he's accountable ."
O,He should be held accountable .
O,There's too much concentration of wealth and power in the small group of individuals who feel completely exempt from responsibility or from consequences .
O,All right .
O,We're gonna talk about consequences next .
O,We get back .
O,We're here with Anna Weener .
O,"She's the author of Uncanny Valley , a memoir ."
O,She's getting great reviews right now about her time at a startup in Silicon Valley .

O,We're here with Anna Weener .
O,She's the author of Uncanny Valley A Memoir .
O,"So , Anna , one of the things I want you to read another section that you like ."
O,And then I want to talk about some where the implications are going in .
O,"A question I got from Twitter , which I think is very fair ."
O,"It's that many people do see this book is an indictment of Silicon Valley and where we are , though you do not ."
O,"And I do not either , actually ."
O,"But there are a lot of people of color , women , people of color especially , have been saying these things for a long time and are not heard ."
O,I want to talk about who gets hurt in this culture as re-import .
O,"But first , do a quick reading first ."
O,Sure .
O,Maybe I'll read something related to what you just said .
O,I do think it's an indictment of the culture and the structural dimension of this of industry .
O,But non-indictment of any individual or company .
O,That's why I didn't name individual .
O,"I want to talk about that , too ."
O,OK .
O,Let's see .
O,"Let me read about Grace Hopper , please ."
O,You know .
O,I flew to Phoenix for an annual conference of women in computing .
O,The conference had been established in honor of a female engineer who helped develop military technologies during the Second World War .
O,"A nod , perhaps inadvertent , to the industries under acknowledged government origins ."
O,"On the plane , I joked with my seatmate about whether the National Security Agency would have a recruitment booth , a bad joke that only got worse when I learned that the NSA was one of the conference's major patrons ."
O,"I was not really a woman in computing , more a woman around computing a woman with a computer , but I was curious and the open source startup was a conference sponsor , all interested employees , regardless of gender , were invited to attend ."
O,"Well , nobody was excited to explore Phoenix City , whose downtown appeared to be a series of interconnected parking lots ."
O,The company put us up in a boutique hotel with a pool and a Mexican restaurant .
O,The restaurant bar quickly became our new headquarters .
O,"On the first night , my co-workers gathered over bowls of guacamole and sweaty margaritas ."
O,"I hovered on the periphery , hoping the women engineers would adopt me ."
O,"I found them intimidating , smart , passionate about their work and unafraid to call bullshit , at least in the privacy of their own cohort ."
O,I had no conception of what it would be like as a woman in tech whose skillset was respected .
O,I was disappointed to learn that it wasn't too dissimilar from being a woman whose skill set wasn't .
O,"For the most part , the other women seemed glad that some of the company's problems had been exposed ."
O,Too many people puking in the elevator metaphorically and not too many unexamined disparities .
O,"The obsession with meritocracy had always been suspect at a prominent international company that was overwhelmingly white , male and American , and had fewer than 15 women in engineering ."
O,"For years , my co-workers explained , the absence of an official org chart had given rise to a secondary shadow org chart determined by social relationships and proximity to the founders ."
O,Employees who were technically rank and file had executive level power and leverage .
O,"Those with the ear of the CEO could influence hiring decisions , internal policies and the reputational standing of their colleagues ."
O,"Flat structure , except for pay and responsibilities , set an internal tools developer rolling her eyes ."
O,It's probably easier to be a furry at this company than a woman .
O,"It's true , though ."
O,Absolutely .
O,Like her ?
O,"Yeah , like the one that is ."
O,Absolutely .
O,I was looking for the money .
O,Who gets paid and who did it ?
O,"Years ago , I did a story called The Men and No Women on Facebook ."
O,And I just put pictures up .
O,"I said , here , look , look here ."
O,I think I remember that it was just pictures .
O,"And then I did the same thing , the men and no women on boards of Internet companies , because that's somewhere where you can find a lot of diversity , where you can easily pick for that , Kara ."
O,They just haven't earned it .
O,They just haven't had the mirror standard .
O,They know steroids .
O,I always get we have standards .
O,"I'm like , where did you pick the 10 idiots who are running the company now ?"
O,Because you're running it into the ground .
O,"And so one of the things I will say is it's a mirror autocracy , not a meritocracy ."
O,And so that's one of their lines .
O,"The meritocracy thing , which is complete bullshit when it comes to pay equity and everything else ."
O,So talk about that issue .
O,"One of the questions on Twitter was this idea that people of color , for example , have been saying this for a long time and that people like you or Susan Fowler at Uber when they write memos ."
O,Then suddenly people pay attention to this issue .
O,"And again , you're getting a lot of attention for this ."
O,Do you have a bath ?
O,That's right .
O,The idea of who gets voice and and who's set .
O,"When people say things , whether they're heard or not ."
O,"Yeah , it's a great question ."
O,Do you want to be clear that I feel that my project's pretty different from Susan Fowlers ?
O,Susan Fowler is a whistleblower .
O,She's her book's called Whistleblower .
O,I am not a whistleblower .
O,This book is not polemical .
O,It's not academic .
O,"There are people who've been working on diversity , inclusion , people who've been working in academia around content moderation and on content moderation and on on platform responsibility and ethics and a like ."
O,I don't feel that I'm contributing a new idea to the conversation .
O,That's not what I'm trying to do .
O,I'm writing about my own life and my own experiences in the last decade in this industry .
O,And my hope is that it is a personal narrative that will be interesting and entertaining and illuminating .
O,But it's not .
O,"I would never position myself as like a savior or whistleblower or , you know , this is a memoir ."
O,This isn't .
O,"Yeah , but you don't want something done ."
O,You're not necessarily calling for things to be done .
O,But I don't I don't know about ISIS .
O,There isn't a book with us .
O,What do you must have an idea of what you think has to happen or what is going to happen ?
O,Yeah .
O,I mean I'm not I don't have the hubris of my former peers to think that I'm the person to provide solutions .
O,I have some ideas of what could be helpful .
O,"Well , let's talk about those ."
O,Okay .
O,"Well , let me go back to your question , though , about who gets who gets hurt ."
O,All right .
O,Because I think that that's important .
O,I wrote a piece for The New Yorker after Susan Fowler did release her memo .
O,"And it was sort of about how she was best positioned to be a whistleblower inside of Uber , especially inside of that culture , which sounds incredibly toxic ."
O,"And for various reasons , we can link to Mike Isaacson ."
O,"You know , Susan Fowler was white ."
O,She was young .
O,She's attractive .
O,She was technical .
O,She had published books in her field .
O,She had taken she had notes .
O,"You know , she had documentation of everything that happened ."
O,She had screenshots .
O,She had she did everything by the book .
O,Any one of those things ?
O,Had they been different ?
O,I think the reaction would have been to undermine and discredit her immediately .
O,And people tried to do it anyway .
O,And so I think she certainly had locked it down .
O,And the presentation was also good .
O,Her presentation to the world .
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , write her the tone of that memo that she published on her blog was even keeled ."
O,It was rational .
O,"It was non-emotional , unemotional ."
O,"So , yeah , all of which is to say , I mean , I think that I think it's a problem ."
O,I think who gets hurt in society is a problem .
O,"It's not it's not that one that I can solve as like a white , privileged Jewish woman ."
O,It's one that I can do my best to be aware of and try to bring other voices into the conversation .
O,It's something I think about in my reporting .
O,"But yeah , I take that criticism seriously ."
O,I don't know .
O,"I don't feel personally responsible , but I think that I am implicated and I'm aware of that ."
O,"But yeah , I mean , I think that's another big conversation I have about publishing about these companies ."
O,"Who gets not just who gets hired , but who has like internal clout ."
O,"I mean , I saw this at one of the companies I worked for ."
O,"You know , there's a lot of talk and a lot of excitement and a lot of really hard work being done in terms of diversity and inclusion initiatives ."
O,And then that all can disappear in an instant based on hierarchical decision .
O,So I don't know if I'm really answering the question again .
O,"So when you talk about what can be done , what has to happen ?"
O,"I mean , one of the things is more voices , because more voices creates a question of what people are doing ."
O,I'm firmly of the belief that a lot of these platforms would have been safer had there been more voices in the rooms .
O,"Second , those voices were in the room ."
O,They just weren't .
O,Listen .
O,That's what I mean .
O,He has not listened to .
O,And who doesn't who doesn't get to call the shots .
O,And I think people's as empathetic as people can be .
O,No .
O,Anybody can be empathetic to other people's experiences .
O,"But you tend not to be empathetic when you're in a homogeneous situation , which often these people are , or they're being constantly lauded for being perfect ."
O,"When you're told you're perfect , you think everything you do is perfect and therefore you can't make any mistakes ."
O,"And therefore , a mistake is not a mistake , its critics or whatever ."
O,"Or there's the thing there's this phrase that people often use in tech on balance , and it's not exclusive to tech , but on balance , what you're doing is good and smart for all of these negative consequences are sort of worth it ."
O,"You know , it's down for the cause ."
O,The end game is it nets out .
O,I find that sort of like economic logic that's applied to like social moral issues .
O,Horrifying .
O,"Yeah , but I think that ."
O,"Yeah , like you said , it's it's empathy has its limits , right , it's actually about power , it's about who can take action and how quickly and the extent to which they can make change internally in a product ."
O,So so what are the solution there ?
O,Because I think right now the reaction has been victimhood .
O,But I am seeing glimmers of that of new founders not putting up with that more .
O,"Lots of different things happening where people are saying , you know , you're ."
O,I get it a lot .
O,"Like , I'll have a people attack me from the companies and then people work there , say thank you ."
O,Which is really interesting .
O,It's a very different thing .
O,And so you can hear sort of people really being discomforted about what they've done and what they've created .
O,"And at the same time , they don't want to feel badly about the whole thing ."
O,Right .
O,"Again , what you're saying , on balance , some of it is good ."
O,But to be able to correct it .
O,What do you imagine ?
O,Some of the solutions have to happen just where businesses .
O,And that's what we are .
O,I keep saying that to them .
O,All you do is make money .
O,That's what you're doing .
O,You're selling stuff or you're selling dating or selling communications or you're selling .
O,I don't think acknowledging that these are businesses is a solution .
O,I think that's like step one in self awareness because it's business is not morally superior or not in any way .
O,I think it helps to look at the problems of the industry right now .
O,"I think some of the some of them not all of them have to do with at the company level with these questions of who has clout , who has buy in , was leverage , diversity , inclusion ."
O,"I think in terms of the industry and the products and the business models that are most popular , I think I do think venture capital has a lot to do with it ."
O,"There's injections of capital that the end game for , which is usually Monopoly ."
O,"But I think it's also like centralization , privatization on the Internet , like ad optimized for advertising , these sort of atomizing social networks or products ."
O,"And so if then you've look at the flip of that , like what does it look like to have decentralized platforms or to have collective ownership or to have more transparency about data collection ?"
O,I'm really excited about the prospect of regulation .
O,I know that a lot of what has been proposed is it isn't quite right .
O,But I I'm curious if you if you would agree with this .
O,"My instinct is , is that companies like in financial tech companies that are already operating inside of regulated industries tend to have healthier workplace cultures because they're beholden to something ."
O,Right .
O,"I mean , obviously , there's a lot of law breaking and other U.S. and other realms ."
O,But does that track for you ?
O,I'm saying I think there are .
O,People are dying for roles .
O,"Again , it's like children ."
O,Yes .
O,You can ease to eat sugar all night .
O,"And yes , you can stay up and dance ."
O,What other repercussions ?
O,Right .
O,"Like people at some point , people like consistence consistency ."
O,They like rules .
O,You can't do this .
O,You can't do this .
O,And they like to then chafe against the rules like .
O,"And that's where it seems like I was having an argument , someone ."
O,"And I was like , look , let's just get some rules into place and then we can argue about the best ones , about how to do this or how to maybe there should be some sort of , you know , a way to control what the regulations are going to be ."
O,But no regulations creates this .
O,This is what happens .
O,"And therefore , nobody's in charge and therefore , no one's accountable for anything ."
O,And and they can continue to do what they want to do with unfettered amounts of money and unfettered amounts of power .
O,"And one of the striking things about Silicon Valley , which I still get to this day , is the lack that want to push away power ."
O,I don't have power .
O,"The we the word use , I elicit a language a lot , too ."
O,"When you talk here , a lot of people talking men together , we need to solve this problem ."
O,"And unlike together , we didn't create an issue of this problem ."
O,"You know , we all need to work together ."
O,And I think all of the leaders talk like that .
O,I'm like your you got all the benefits .
O,"We got none of the benefits we got or maybe a free map or a you know , we're cheap dates to these companies and then told to clean it up like we have to clean up the toxic waste ."
O,And that's where I really I don't quite know how that gets solved except by regulation .
O,Right .
O,Or just a dramatic re imagining of what the business model is .
O,Right .
O,"Like , I think a lot of the cultural problems are actually expressions of ."
O,"The incentives of venture capital of this , you have this injection of capital ."
O,There's a ton of urgency .
O,You have to grow really quickly .
O,You have to scale .
O,The idea is that you should reach as many people as possible with a fairly homogenous product internationally if when when possible .
O,There's just no this this emphasis on speed is something I just keep returning to .
O,Like the relationship to time and .
O,I don't know how you .
O,Can encourage people to act responsibly when you have that dimension .
O,Like I just was talking to someone about recently about Uber and how their self-driving car hit a jaywalker and she died .
O,And that was because the car wasn't it didn't they hadn't written in as a rule or whatever parameter of potential situation that that jaywalking could happen .
O,And so she was mistaken for a piece of cardboard .
O,I think it was .
O,And that's a acceptable mistake to make .
O,"If you are working on it , we're gonna product that's like a a game or go you have a bug in your code you like dead and consider all of the possible use cases for your productivity software , you know , whatever ."
O,It's an egregious oversight .
O,There's absolutely no reason that should have happened for a self-driving car .
O,It's like .
O,"And I think that that is the application of an engineering culture that is specific to like consumer facing products or even B2B products that when it moves into the physical world , is is is beyond reckless ."
O,"But they're operating under the same incentives , if that makes sense ."
O,"Like you wouldn't see that engineering culture at Boeing , right ?"
O,"No , not at all ."
O,Although look at that variable analogy .
O,"Sorry , I would say yes , but there've been infected by the idea of speed in getting things done rather well ."
O,"Everyone has like an innovation lab , right ?"
O,It's like a 3-D printer .
O,Yeah .
O,"So when you do in-shore , let's finish up time at we're where you wanted you to come up with ."
O,"I don't want you to boil things down , but what are the messages you want people to take away from this memoir ?"
O,This is just Anna's time in Silicon Valley or my book about me behind me also .
O,"I mean , I think the book is pretty ambivalent , right ?"
O,"I think I personally have strong feelings about tech , but I wanted it to be emotionally truthful ."
O,My experience here .
O,I personally think it's politically useful for people to just understand how people talk about things here .
O,Who are the intellectuals in this ?
O,"Personally , I believe to be anti-intellectual ."
O,Yes .
O,Historical culture .
O,Who ?
O,"What does it look like when people are making decisions inside of these companies , what's mundane , what is what's an ordinary day at a workplace like ?"
O,"And so I think tech is really good at storytelling , but also be at obfuscation , at like sort of having this sort of mystified culture , not mystify ."
O,That's the wrong word .
O,It has a lot of mystique .
O,"And I think if I can help demystify some of that and explain what it has been like in this particular time and place , I think that that's useful ."
O,And that's my hundred percent .
O,"And of the many truths that you're telling here , what do you think ?"
O,"To me , I think the what I come away from this book is , which I think , you know , completely , which I talk about a lot , is the carelessness , is the lack of care ."
O,And I don't know how else to put it .
O,It's not sloppiness .
O,It's not .
O,It's just lack of care and I don't understand .
O,"Again , it's juvenile , it's lack of like ."
O,It's not leaving things except it's not like my kid leaving his room a mess .
O,It's creating real damage and not not caring because I do not .
O,I don't think that's really it .
O,"It's the lack of care in it happening , the lack of ability to understand consequences ."
O,And I think that's one of the good parts that I got out of this .
O,"Well , yeah , I think ."
O,Thank you .
O,I think that what's exciting to people who are building things is not the consequences .
O,It's the building of the thing .
O,"And when you talk to people about programming who love programming , like they're telling you about the system , they're telling you about the puzzle solving and problem solving ."
O,And it's .
O,"I guess I'm sympathetic to that to a certain extent , but it's also as if it's fully divorced from any real world applications or consequences ."
O,And I don't know .
O,"I had a conversation with someone at a party once where I was their CEO of a platform and I was like , are you worried at all about disinformation or , you know , what do you do ?"
O,"Because I was working in like content moderation , konta moderation policy at the time ."
O,"And I was like , how do you how are you dealing with us ?"
O,You like getting a lot of white supremacist content as well .
O,"And he was like , oh , I don't really know ."
O,I'm actually really interested in the machine learning applications of our user generated content .
O,And I was like .
O,Right .
O,Of course you are .
O,This is the these other problems are for the user experience team to take care of .
O,And I guess I am in a situation like that .
O,It makes perfect sense to me .
O,"I just it also it's like , right , you shouldn't have to care about that , but you also shouldn't have this much power over like a pretty widely used user generated content platform ."
O,So I don't know .
O,"I feel again at this happening again to me , this is what I mean about my terrible personality ."
O,Why am I making excuses for these people ?
O,I am constantly running up against it .
O,I don't know .
O,I don't know .
O,I think it's because I have this is just who I am .
O,It's like I'm .
O,They haven't earned it .
O,They don't deserve it .
O,"And I'm like going about for people who couldn't give less of a shit about me and also like , don't need it ."
O,They don't need my protection .
O,But I spidering spiraling out here .
O,I to my therapist .
O,I am here because I think they're awful .
O,A lot of them are awful .
O,"Yeah , that's also true ."
O,That's also true .
O,Right .
O,Awful and careless people .
O,How do you know that ?
O,"You know , I always use The Great Gatsby , quote , Remember Daisy and her husband's name , her careless people , the famous Fitzgerald quote about at the end of Great Gatsby ."
O,"They moved on , they did damage and moved on to their protected lives ."
O,All I remember at the end of The Great Gatsby .
O,So we beat on boats against porn against the current .
O,It is one of the quotes .
O,I haven't read that for the simile .
O,Yeah .
O,Fourteen .
O,Yeah .
O,There's still so .
O,So when you when you want to when you think about where is going next .
O,I'd like you to finish up talking about that .
O,Where do you imagine is what are you covering now .
O,What do you think is important ?
O,I mean I think that what has kept me writing about Silicon Valley and what has kept me living in San Francisco is a lot of the same stuff that brought me here in the first place .
O,I'm most interested in writing about employee culture or workplace culture .
O,What people do when they live here .
O,"You know , what are they do for fun ?"
O,What does that tell us about ?
O,About this business ?
O,Trying to think of a specific example I can share .
O,So what do you mean ?
O,"Most of my reporting , my writing is cultural comment or commentary or reporting on the sort of broader implications of a particular company saying so ."
O,It's not like hard hitting investigative journalism .
O,"And I take great pleasure in that , I think , because it speaks to a more ordinary experience in this place rather than like a story about what's happening in a board meeting ."
O,Right .
O,"Though I you know , if anyone has tips , I would welcome them ."
O,But I .
O,I don't know .
O,"For me , it's the human drama ."
O,It's like this ambition .
O,The way people feel when they're here .
O,"I find all of that really , really interesting ."
O,Those are the stories that I want to be telling .
O,And you haven't also left San Francisco .
O,"Oh , no ."
O,I'm probably here for a long time unless I get run out .
O,So I don't think you're doing it right .
O,I'll read you The Great Gatsby quote .
O,"Oh , thank you ."
O,Vanish .
O,It was all very careless and confused .
O,"They were careless people , Tom and Daisy ."
O,They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money and their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they made .
O,I think we're gonna get them to clean it up .
O,That's my goal .
O,And stuff like that .
O,But I really appreciate this book .
O,It's a wonderful book by Anna Wiener .
O,"She's a writer for The New Yorker , which you write about lots of different things for them ."
O,And she's also the author of a book that you really should read called Uncanny Valley A Memoir .
O,It's beautifully written .
O,And I really appreciate you being here .
O,And I don't mind that you're nice to them .
O,You're your boss .
O,"Nice than you think actually to at the same time , even though you're empathetic , hard to find ."
O,You're killing them with kindness is how I would put it .
