O,You cannot be afraid to fail .
O,I would never be in an environment that was so emotionally charged .
O,Q The reason you're telling your second grade daughter that she's moving next week .
O,The fight started and I hit her as hard as I could and she actually fell down .
O,I have an 8 year old son there's no way I let him play football .
O,I wanna leave this sport be known as embattlement .
O,Maybe you are an obsessive sports fan or maybe a more casual fan than you follow just a couple of sports teams .
O,Or maybe you pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV .
O,Whichever the case when you do see those athletes .
O,It's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context .
O,As a full grown adult wearing a uniform .
O,Performing under extraordinary pressure focused on a highly specialized task that has ZERO to do with daily life or at least your daily life .
O,But is that who those people really are .
O,And how they get so good at this thing they do .
O,When you see them on TV all you're seeing is the outcome .
O,But what were the inputs .
O,We understand that elite athletes represent some magical combination of talent and determination .
O,But what about say .
O,Luck .
O,Oh my gosh .
O,I yes absolutely .
O,I think a a ton of luck is involved .
O,That's Shawn Johnson an American gymnast who's won an Olympic gold medal and many other top honors .
O,It's kind of like this miracle math kind of equation that has stayed equal the perfect answer .
O,I mean you can't get hurt .
O,You have to be healthy .
O,You can't have the flu on the wrong day .
O,You have to find the right coach and the right city below it all these random things and when you like .
O,Get all the people who fit that equation you're not left with many people .
O,So I guess I was just the best of the very few who fit that equation .
O,Today on Freakonomics Radio the third installment in a series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode .
O,We looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing to our more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement .
O,Freeman .
O,Fifty nine point four seconds .
O,The four minute mile .
O,A trip .
O,In episode 2 .
O,We looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise the San Francisco 49ers and how they had begun to recover from a debilitating losing streak .
O,I mean when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually threes like Armageddon .
O,Try nine .
O,In today's episode .
O,Becoming an athlete .
O,Time to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heights How scientific is the process .
O,How predictable .
O,We'll look at a number of factors including of course raw talent .
O,My parents are both super studly athletes .
O,I think the gift is number one to look at will and determination .
O,I did a bunch of pushups and sit ups that night and toe was throwing up and the mental aspect of this most physical pursuit .
O,Well I think the mind is is as big of a separator for professional athletes as any physical tools .
O,We'll hear stories of opportunities gained and lost in 1981 .
O,It was eighteen point seven percent black African-American players in the major leagues .
O,As of 2018 seven point eight percent .
O,And we'll hear one story that's almost too good to be true .
O,They said hey you are blowing up on Twitter or you're blowing up my Instagram you know you're everywhere and you just have no idea .
O,From stitchers and Dubnyk productions this is Freakonomics Radio the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything .
O,Here's your host Stephen Dubner .
O,When you see an elite performer in any field of sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself a question how would they get it .
O,How much of that ability were they born with .
O,How much is attributable to hard work and practice .
O,This is a debate that's been going on probably forever .
O,Nature versus Nurture RAW Talent versus what's called deliberate practice .
O,We've had that debate on this program most recently in an episode called How to become great at just about anything .
O,Too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious fact to become great at anything .
O,I need both talent and practice .
O,Lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think .
O,Because athletic success like any success in life or any failure it's what you might call multifactorial .
O,A lot of inputs a lot of variables .
O,Imagine you've got two athletes with identical talent levels and identical training methods .
O,Do you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success into science into a recipe .
O,Real life is more nuanced than that .
O,Also more interesting .
O,So I mean .
O,Chese sold drugs .
O,Grew up in Marcy Projects to a single mother .
O,That's Dominique Foxworth who played six seasons in the NFL .
O,Now he is a Mawle Thai multimillionaire married to Beyonce .
O,The most amazing talent we have today .
O,So why don't we set it up so that all young men must sell drugs when their kids and and have only their mother and grow up and Marcy Projects in Brooklyn New York .
O,I mean he had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a great deal of luck like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on him like that is like a lot of luck in that to me .
O,And I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be that should be followed .
O,Understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy .
O,So okay we are not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but we'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors .
O,Let's start with physical ability .
O,It may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age mark to share for instance a three time Major League Baseball All-Star .
O,Yes .
O,And most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best kid on your team .
O,You know I played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport from the outset always was .
O,And I actually enjoyed playing basketball more .
O,I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and but I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be a sport for my future athletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in Super Freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve Levitt we performed a rough calculation showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about 800 times more likely than a random boy to also make the majors .
O,So it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families .
O,Here's Kerri Walsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and beach volleyball .
O,OH MAN Well my my life has literally been family and sports leagues from day one .
O,I think from birth my parents are both super studly athletes .
O,They both come from very athletic families .
O,My parents are both athletic and that's the alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin who's won two Olympic gold medals .
O,My mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgeries and hand surgeries neck surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete .
O,Well I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up and the gold medal gymnast Shawn Johnson .
O,He was a hockey player .
O,He wrestled he did BMX .
O,He raced moto x .
O,I mean everything .
O,Just how powerful is the Sports Gene .
O,David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called The Sports Gene .
O,In it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas .
O,Donald is about six to lean Bahamian guy Thomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri .
O,But he was far from an elite player in the college program was far from elite .
O,One day in the gym he was bragging about how high he could jump and the best jumper on the track team a guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash .
O,You wouldn't even clear a bar of six foot six in a real competition and Dowd says yes .
O,Yes I would .
O,So they go out to the track and Carlos sets the high jump bar at 6 feet 6 inches .
O,Donald still wearing his basketball sneakers runs up jumps clears it easily .
O,Carlos moves the bar higher and higher .
O,Donald keeps clearing it .
O,We're talking about the first jumps of his life .
O,He's going over the bar backward of course which he'd never done before .
O,And Carlos gets the Bartis seven feet in Down and clears 7 feet .
O,At which point Carlos is worried he's going to hurt himself .
O,DONALD THOMAS soon moved on to Auburn University on track scholarship and not long after that he competed in the world track championships .
O,DONALD THOMAS .
O,Very much an unknown quantity really .
O,Thomas was jumping against much more experienced and accomplished athletes .
O,Donald .
O,Thomas .
O,Grocery .
O,Store .
O,Owner .
O,Two years ago .
O,There .
O,An incredible jump .
O,Hand .
O,Not only does he win but he records the highest center of mass jump ever in history .
O,He doesn't set the world record because his form is so bad he looks like he's riding an invisible Deckchair through the air .
O,It turned out that Donald Thomas had a physiological treat an abnormally long Achilles tendon that gave him a big advantage .
O,So there aren't that many down Thomases in terms of winning the World Championships .
O,But this happens at lower levels all the time where somebody will step in with no or very little background and win some kind of regional or state championship .
O,And and those are the people who end up training and going on to become champions .
O,David Epstein also writes about the success of Talent Transfer Programs in the UK Australia China and elsewhere .
O,We'll ill take people who maybe aren't making a national team or making it to the top in a certain sport and say hey why don't you go try this other stuff .
O,Some converted athletes have done remarkably well .
O,The UK won several gold medals in rowing and skeleton with athletes who began in other sports in the 2002 Winter Olympics .
O,The Australian Alisa Camplin a converted sailor won gold in aerial skiing .
O,She wins the Olympic gold medal and was still so poor at skiing that when she was invited to ski down the mountain to the gold medal winners press conference she fell in like rolled down the mountain on the winner's flowers because she's still not a ski ARCI .
O,She learned how to ski later on vacation but not by the time she had won the Olympic gold medal .
O,Yet I think the gift is number one mark to share again because without the gift you can't take a kid that has zero athletic ability and just happens to be a hard worker and he goes to the big leagues .
O,But talent on its own as we all know it only gets you so far at any given time there's 1000 big leaguers out there .
O,But there's probably 10000 players whether in college or amateur baseball or low professional ranks that are good enough to someday make talent wise Vatten Yes there's 10000 talented players with a gift .
O,It's of those 10000 players which are the ones that work hard enough which are the ones that figure it out which are the ones that get it that make the right decisions and you train the right way and eat the right way and do preparation for games .
O,Those are the ones that make it the most talented player that I ever saw as an amateur was Corey Patterson and he had a decent big league career but talent wise I would kill for his talent and talent wise .
O,There were a ton of guys that I thought had more talent than me but .
O,I thought I figured it out .
O,A brother was inherently more talented than I was .
O,It's J.J. Redick who's played in the NBA since 2006 .
O,He could never shoot basketball the way that I could but he could hit a baseball a mile had a cannon for an arm .
O,My best friend from high school was the same way you certain kids are just everything sort of comes easy to them and it's natural for them .
O,I have seen some of the most physically gifted and talented gymnasts .
O,I think our sport has ever seen Shawn Johnson again .
O,She now coaches young gymnasts but they just do not have the mental capability .
O,To get themselves to that elite level .
O,And it's not a matter of training them or you know getting them to the right sports psychologist or getting the right people around them .
O,It's just it's not there .
O,So I think you have to be born with some sort of innate ability to you know push out all pain and emotion and push yourself past a boundary that 99 percent of the world operates within .
O,I remember being in an apartment we lived in Indianapolis .
O,Dominique Foxworth again and I told my father I wanted to be a professional football player .
O,He was 8 years old and he told me .
O,All right well you set a goal you should do something to get you closer to that goal every day .
O,And I took that to heart .
O,So I did a bunch of pushups and sit ups that night until I was throwing up .
O,It's like ridiculous .
O,What was it that gave Foxworth such an intense drive for football .
O,I was in love with the game in part because of how violent it was .
O,Honestly I like whatever warped sense of masculinity I had at that age that probably has not fully left me it was like basketball is for the soft kids .
O,Football is for the men and I want to play football .
O,I trained my ass off .
O,I loved it .
O,And then when I got in the race I just .
O,Didn't want to lose .
O,That's Lance Armstrong the seven time Tour de France champion who was stripped of his titles when it was proved that he along with many cyclists of his era had been doping .
O,I'd asked Armstrong what drove him when he was a kid .
O,Is a 46 year old and I look back on it and really really far removed from that part of my life that probably things I didn't have .
O,I didn't grow up on the street but I didn't grow up behind a white picket fence with you know two point three brothers and sisters in an SUV and had a mom and a dad .
O,My mom and I were scrappers and I never met my biological father and I'm not making excuses here but I'm just trying to you know there wasn't the only father figures in my life where my coaches did you .
O,I was going to ask you did you ride angry .
O,I don't mean quite angry but you were you know really angry and confident .
O,All right .
O,Angry yeah .
O,I didn't walk around angry I just felt it .
O,It served me best to be angry .
O,The anger part and I also know that this happens in every locker room of every sport .
O,So let's just say right let's just choose Texas football and Oklahoma .
O,Football is the biggest rivalry you have the week leading up to the game .
O,Those coaches every single day .
O,Guess what is posted on the board .
O,And the University of Texas Longhorns locker room meeting room .
O,It is articles and quotes from the other team .
O,We're going to kick their ass .
O,That's so and so player he's he's mediocre in the coaches .
O,They love that .
O,Hey Joey did you see what number 82 said about you .
O,And so we if we did if I didn't have that if I didn't have a rival speaking out in the press saying oh I saw Armstrong last week he looked average he he looked he looked like he's past his best .
O,If I didn't have that which I did plenty of times then I'd make it up .
O,I'd go read some article that say that mother .
O,Can you believe that he said that and the next day I go out and train and I mean it would be the only thing on my mind now .
O,It sounds a little toxic but it made me write harder made me train harder made me hustle .
O,You know I think my insecurity drives me really really hard .
O,Kerri Walsh Jennings again at every kind of leveling up you know from eighth grade to high school high school to college college to the Olympic team .
O,There was a moment there were many moments of insecurity in the transition .
O,Many moments of oh sh can I do this am I good enough .
O,It's exhausting .
O,It's really exhausting .
O,I want to leave this sport being known as a bad mother .
O,So yes most of the athletes we've heard from were extraordinarily driven and talented .
O,But of course they've also had to work incredibly hard at perfecting their craft .
O,Most always remember Donald Thomas our high jumping friend .
O,All .
O,Of us grow .
O,David Epstein interviewed Thomas's college track coach and they said they would usually find him like outside shooting free throws when he was supposed to be inside learning how to high jump .
O,Most athletes however do train incredibly hard in part because they're not allowed not to buy their coaches their teams maybe their parents but of course they also push themselves .
O,I think it's about how much you want it how much you love it and how much you're willing to sacrifice for it .
O,Mike McGlinchey is a rookie offensive lineman on the San Francisco 49ers .
O,He was a ninth player chosen in this year's draft .
O,I was never the best athlete on my team .
O,I was I'm I'm still not the best athlete on my on my team here .
O,But I've always wanted it more .
O,I've always worked harder than everybody else .
O,Just attention to detail and the things that you need to know how to self correct you need to know how to learn knowing how to learn is particularly valuable when the skills you're trying to learn are unusual .
O,Playing off the line is one of the more unnatural human movements on Earth and for I think you're required to move other large man out of the way .
O,And when you're trying to stop them and pass protection you're completely moving backwards so it's a really really different thing to have to learn how to do and until your body can feel it until you can watch it on film and self-diagnosis right when things happen .
O,That's where the separation comes in .
O,So he's like pretty difficult .
O,But Simone manual who won two gold and two silver medals at the 2016 Olympics .
O,Because you're in the water which is like totally defying gravity .
O,You have to work out every day because if you're out the water for one day even when I take my day off on Sunday when I come back Monday morning I feel terrible .
O,And you have to kind of practice all of those aspects of a sport on a regular basis or else you're not going to improve .
O,There's also the fact that the training opportunities in some sports are inherently constrained .
O,Skier eating is a really unique sport in many ways .
O,Mikael Schiffrin when you think about it the actual time that I spend or any racer spends on the Hill actually skiing during a day of training let's say you get one course length is about 60 seconds long and you get seven runs in one training session and that takes about somewhere between three to five hours depending on how long the chairlift takes .
O,So you're adding up about seven minutes total of practice in your sport for the entire training session which is comparative to say three to five hours of somebody playing tennis in a single session which makes me feel like the deliberate practice component is that much more central .
O,You know there's skiers out there teammates of mine in the past who spend their time from the top of the chairlift to the top of the race course .
O,It could be .
O,Half of a trail length that they're skiing down and they're just kind of like flailing about and doing whatever and I was like doing drills to the top of the course trying to make use of every square inch of space on the mountain .
O,Every time I'm deliberately practicing skiing and my technique and everything then I'm kind of getting a one up on everybody else who's not because it's so demanding to master the skill set that accompanies each sport whether it's skiing or swimming or football .
O,You can imagine an aspiring athlete would want to spend as much time as possible on that skill set and not waste time on say other sports .
O,This has become a huge debate in youth sports .
O,At what age should an athlete stop playing other sports and commit to theirs .
O,And once they do commit .
O,Is it definitively better to spend most of your time in a deliberate structured practice .
O,Or what about a more free flowing unstructured environment with sometimes called deliberate play .
O,You know I totally agree with this this notion that there's something to be gained from less structure .
O,That again is the NBA veteran J.J. Redick as an example .
O,He brings up his former teammate Jamal Crawford .
O,Jamal is one of the best ball handlers in NBA history said a fantastic career .
O,Jamal will tell you he's really never done a drill .
O,He's never done a ball handling drill but he has incredible ball handling skills and he's done that through just playing pickup or taking a basketball around his neighborhood when he was growing up and literally putting moves on bystanders as he passed them in the street .
O,Radix own view on unstructured versus structured practice is still evolving .
O,I had a teammate in Orlando's name was Anthony Johnson I play with him for two years .
O,He was much older .
O,This was early in my career and about five years after Rubiaceae playing together I met up with him for lunch and I was telling him about all the workouts I was doing that summer and he said to me dude don't worry about being the best workout guy worry about being the best player .
O,And it kind of annoyed me when he said that but I thought about him saying that probably 50 times over the last five years .
O,For me part of it is I want structure .
O,I feel like I thrive in structure .
O,I like having a plan .
O,I like going to a gym and saying this is what I'm going to work on a day .
O,But then the other part of it is a sport .
O,Right .
O,There's something organic about it .
O,There's something that has to flow naturally and if your point of reference is only structure well the game is not really structured right .
O,You're constantly reacting to things as they happen there's nine other players there's one ball .
O,And so I think that's actually been incredible advice for me over last five years of my career .
O,JJ Redick grew up in rural Virginia and his practice environment then was pretty unstructured .
O,My dad put up a hoop and it was just for me being in that backyard and shooting a basketball and seeing it go through the net became just an obsession and it's something that I wanted to do over and over again and repeat over and over again .
O,Lately Reddick has tried to reconnect with the unstructured practice environment .
O,You get a safe place to work on your weaknesses and improve those weaknesses .
O,Look if I go into a gym and I've got 30 people in the gym watching even at thirty four I'm going in my 13th year in the NBA .
O,It's a little nerve wracking to work on your weaknesses in front of people in a structured setting but alone away from any lights you know .
O,It's a more calming experience and you can gain confidence from doing that .
O,So what does the research say about the relative benefits of structured versus unstructured practice or what you might call deliberate practice versus deliberate play .
O,One study of 22 young Brazilian basketball players tried to answer this question .
O,The researchers put half the players in organized games with referees and coaches .
O,The other half played in unstructured games after 18 sessions .
O,The researchers measured the change in the players tactical intelligence and creativity .
O,The kids in the unstructured practice showed significant gains on both dimensions .
O,The kids who played in the structured games showed no improvement .
O,It's just one small study but it would seem to offer some evidence at least on the youth level that less structure can be beneficial .
O,How about specialization .
O,A lot of young athletes and especially their parents seem to think the best move is to pick your sport early and focus solely on that sport .
O,Man it drives me nutty .
O,Kerri Walsh Jennings it's just I think it's such a flawed place to come from specialization in anything let alone when you're a child and you're 8 years old .
O,You do not need to pick your sport that you're going to maybe get a college scholarship for you know and play 365 24/7 which is mentally and spiritually and physically just it'll crush you .
O,So I have a major problem with the way things are right now .
O,I absolutely know that I am a great athlete because I did everything growing up and I wanted to be a great athlete .
O,Yeah I was never that child that turned 10 years old and said Oh my gosh I need to give up everything and everyone and just commit my life to the Olympics .
O,The gymnast Shawn Johnson I had this you know blue collar family all american Midwest just kind of parents that wanted me to be normal and they pushed me to be in so many sports and so many activities and try the oboe and clarinet and piano practice and mock trial and all these things that kind of distracted me from this Olympic dream .
O,It always gave me this perspective of I love everything but I loved gymnastics more and so whenever I was at gymnastics practice I focused more than any other activity and gave more effort there because I knew that was my favorite .
O,There is some research to back up these stories from Johnson and Walsh Jennings .
O,So for example after the last World Cup a group of German scientists published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany .
O,That's David Epstein and he's talking about the 2014 World Cup and found that the athletes who went onto the national team which by the way won that World Cup had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training only by age 22 did they start playing fewer sports and spending more time in structured soccer than athletes who plateaued at lower levels .
O,So this sort of less structured development and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes who go on to become elite OK but what if you are a young athlete or the parent of one and your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athlete but rather to get into an elite university like one of the top 10 schools in the country .
O,You know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem .
O,Steve Levitt my Freakonomics friend and co-author .
O,He's an economist at the University of Chicago .
O,By my calculation about point 4 percent of kids .
O,So about 1 in 250 kids will make it to one of those top 10 schools .
O,And so it's it's a hard hard goal to do it and I can't say I thought about the universe of things you could do but I thought about sports and and I stumbled onto something that was pretty surprising to me .
O,So the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fencer .
O,OK .
O,Now you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist .
O,And the answer is there turn out to be exactly 46 schools that have fencing .
O,But the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high .
O,So for instance among the top 10 ranked schools in the country nine of those 10 have a fencing team .
O,The only exception being my own university University of Chicago .
O,And each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill .
O,There's three different blades there's epee there's Sabor in this foil and there's male there's female fencing and given that relatively few kids in the U.S. are serious youth fencers .
O,So it's something like 6 or 7 percent of the kids you ever try to be fencers end up being college fencers .
O,I'm not saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing .
O,How much does Levit think fencing increases your chances from that point 4 percent baseline .
O,So fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else constant .
O,Something like 15 fold .
O,We should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would still need to be very very good to get into those top schools .
O,That said as an admissions sweetener .
O,How does Lebert think fencing compares to other sports .
O,My God if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer and basketball and football .
O,There's something like 300000 kids playing high school soccer and presumably of those kids would love to be called soccer players .
O,But the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get the cards as opposed to fencing turns out to be about 75 or 80 times harder .
O,So how many of your kids have you turned into fencers .
O,Exactly one .
O,And so far so good .
O,I couldn't say I really turned him into a .
O,He he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about 9 years old and he fence's at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades are good so he knows and I know everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing .
B-AD,Coming up on Freakonomics Radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it is time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or do you would have been a top pick in the draft .
I-AD,The problem was he played at Harvard also .
I-AD,What does it set you back if you pursue the athletic dream and you don't make it the person who plays baseball is making about 40 percent less on average 10 years after they enter the game than the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career .

O,As we've been hearing .
O,There are a lot of inputs that go into the production of any athlete talent drive the right kind of practice .
O,Maybe a parent or two to get you to the rink or the gym or the track at 5 a.m. .
O,And as Shawn Johnson told us earlier you might need some luck .
O,I mean you you can't get her .
O,You can't have the flu on the wrong day .
O,You have to find the right coach in the right city .
O,I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches .
O,So how that happened .
O,It was kind of this freak occurrence .
O,My coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese when he was 3 years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he kind of had this crazy career that I would say almost traumatized him .
O,He lost his childhood .
O,He kind of lost his family .
O,So when he was 21 years old he actually left to China came to the United States opened a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American dream to raise an Olympian .
O,Our Olympians there were also children and had a balance in life and were no fun loving and had a true childhood .
O,Johnson had started her training at a different gym and I loved it .
O,It was awesome but Chow my coach taking me to Bombax opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents house and my parents ended up switching me save gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his guidance and his coaching .
O,I mean I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have very loving very very protective people around me .
O,And he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and .
O,Say that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that .
O,Shawn Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal .
O,But what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck or through something much more concrete like lack of money .
O,Over the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled .
O,More than 15 billion dollars a year .
O,And a lot of youth sports involve some sort of pay to play model pay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business and of itself and less about true true true development .
O,That's Brandon McCarthy .
O,He's been a pitcher in Major League Baseball for 13 seasons .
O,It's a tournament in California this weekend .
O,Next weekend you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them .
O,You know the theme of economics the last 10 or 15 years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer .
O,It sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being mirrored down all the way down the line .
O,Yes I would think so .
O,I mean there's two players on your team and one player at the age 13 level can make all the tournament's in the summer and one can only make two of the tournaments .
O,How much playing time is the player whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play him .
O,I think there's that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to top coaching lessons equipment you name it .
O,Over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worse baseball players or in one noteworthy instance a huge drop in baseball players .
O,In 1981 it was eighteen point seven percent black African-American players in the major leagues as of 2008 18 seven point eight percent .
O,So the question is why the decline .
O,David Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana Studies Program at Connecticut College .
O,The huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players .
O,But he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues .
O,So I look at these factors de-industrialisation mass incarceration and suburbanisation .
O,So it de-industrialisation lack of tax base .
O,We know there's no funds to what construct and maintain ball fields .
O,So you see the rapid decline of physical space in the Bronx in Chicago in these other urban areas which leads to a lack of participation suburbanization .
O,Canton says had a similar effect drawing resources away from cities with large African-American populations .
O,What's left in the cities abandoned fields lack of resources decrease in tax base .
O,And then there's incarceration .
O,Ken Yes which has a disproportionately high impact on African-Americans .
O,So I can imagine 1980 if you were 18 year old black man in L.A. Chicago New York all of a sudden you're getting locked up for nonviolent offenses .
O,So I'm going to assume that you played baseball .
O,I'm arguing that those men if you did a survey and go to prison a day federal state I bet you a nice percentage these guys played baseball .
O,Now some were not old enough to have children .
O,And the one that did weren't there to teach their son to play baseball to volunteer in little league because they were in jail for nonviolent offenses .
O,Add it all up .
O,David Kempton says and this explains the huge decline of African-Americans in baseball which by the way has been countered by a huge rise in players from Latin America .
O,That said Major League Baseball is well aware of and concerned by the drop off in African-American players .
O,So we have a league called the RBI League which is reviving baseball in inner cities .
O,That's Kim ang .
O,Major League Baseball's senior vice president of International Baseball development .
O,So we've seen academies develop in Kansas City in Philadelphia New Orleans Washington D.C. and these academies are really providing opportunity for young kids particularly of color to come and train with us free of charge of course .
O,And you really hone their skills .
O,So the RBI program people like CC Sabathia the Yankees he went through it .
O,They do have some success stories but most of those players are not successful .
O,The reality is is that baseball is for people with resources .
O,Most major league players who are African-American come from middle class backgrounds .
O,They have the resource for travel baseball which is expensive personal training and I think there's a cultural thing that if you're middle class African-American you are comfortable being in predominately white spaces .
O,And we don't want to talk about that because as we know everybody's a good person but we know racism privilege our systems .
O,So let me give you example if you play you basketball you're a white guy .
O,Trust me your space is African-American .
O,So from March to July you are going to be a black guys all summer .
O,Your parents get to be a black families all summer .
O,Let's switch to baseball .
O,If you're black middle class kid who grew up in the suburbs you are comfortable being the only black in all white space all summer .
O,So they're the ones that are more likely to be in the major leagues .
O,You could argue that sports are among the most meritocratic endeavors that humans do .
O,After all when you're measuring outcomes with a stopwatch or a yardstick by whether the ball goes in the net or doesn't .
O,You'd think that an athlete's background where they come from what they look like that wouldn't matter much but sometimes it does .
O,Professional sports teams in particular often have a very conservative mindset .
O,They tend to go looking for players who look a lot like their previous players which means they might overlook someone absolutely should not have been overlooked .
O,In 2012 the New York Knicks went on a 9 3 winning streak sparked by an obscure young point guard named Jeremy Lin .
O,Looks like this during the 12 game stretch Lin averaged twenty two and a half points and eight point seven assists .
O,If you don't know basketball numbers but those are good ones Lin's success was so dramatic so unpredicted that it produced a movement .
O,Linsanity continues here in Madison Square Garden .
O,Lin grew up in California to parents who'd immigrated from Taiwan even though he put up great numbers in high school .
O,He received no athletic scholarship offers to college .
O,He wound up playing Harvard while studying economics .
O,Once again he put up great basketball numbers .
O,But when it came time for the NBA draft Jeremy Lin's name was not called the Golden State Warriors signed him as an undrafted free agent making him the first American of Taiwanese or Chinese descent to play in the NBA .
O,But he barely played and three times that year the Warriors sent him down to their minor league club during the NBA's offseason .
O,He played a few games in China then the Knicks signed him And Linsanity broke out Lin is now in his ninth year in the NBA .
O,He's in the final season of a three year deal worth thirty eight point three million dollars .
O,How could someone worth nearly 13 million dollars a year have been assigned a value of essentially zero .
O,Let's ask one of the people who did take an early look at Jeremy Lin .
O,Darryl Morey general manager of the Houston Rockets the rockets have been one of the winningest teams in basketball during Maury's tenure and he was just named NBA executive of the year .
O,More he was also one of the first executives in basketball to make extensive use of analytics to help choose players .
O,So I asked him why Jeremy Lin's college numbers had not lit up his model .
O,Well one thing that was tough about Jeremy because he did actually producing college at a level that looked you know insanely well meaning if he had played at say Kentucky or Duke or whatever for sure he would have been a top pick in the draft .
O,I have no doubt that the promises he played at Harvard and actually most of the models that are used from an analytics perspective to forecast draft picks they're built on people who are drafted and Jeremy didn't look like anyone who was drafted .
O,The number of Ivy League players that have become NBA players is extremely small .
O,So one of the things I have to be careful about with analytics is when to not use things and I incorrectly chose to not waste his time in the Ivy League high enough and we ended up going undrafted Morri and the rockets did however bring Lin into training camp as an undrafted rookie .
O,He actually did look quite good in our training camp but unfortunately at that time we had four point guards .
O,And so yeah we way I then incorrectly let him go .
O,What about his being Asian .
O,How much did that just you know the fact that he did not quote look like what most basketball people think a good basketball player looks like and how much that may have actually obscured the the the real data at the start of an unknowable question .
O,But the founders of behavioral science you know a lot of their research was on yeah how people mostly unconsciously sometimes overtly put people into you know you know basically buckets or categories and then use those for making decisions and often those heuristics really serve you well in life i.e. you know I I've categorized that animal as dangerous and strong and avoid them so they don't eat me right .
O,But many times they don't serve you well .
O,And what you're asking is a question that's impossible to answer as best .
O,How did Jeremy's heritage change how he was viewed by NBA talent evaluators .
O,I don't know how much was that Ivy League how much it was you know .
O,Yeah .
O,No .
O,Nobody knows .
O,The reality was it happens not just in the NBA it happened to him consistently .
O,He was a top player in high school .
O,He then got literally almost no interest from college head coaches but he should have been recruited by the Duke and the Kentucky .
O,And then again he was overlooked in the NBA .
O,No one can really know why but there's obviously a bunch of factors that probably played a role .
O,The more you talk to athletes .
O,And the people around them the more you realize that the path to elite status isn't nearly as predictable as you might imagine .
O,There are cognitive biases involved there is personality and politics and remember luck plainly there's no guarantee that a given athlete will get the right opportunity to make it to the top .
O,But .
O,If you do .
O,Well if you do get the opportunity .
O,That's when the real challenge begins .
O,Now you've got to work even harder devote yourself even more completely .
O,And that comes with a cost .
O,It's the flip side of opportunity and it's what economists call .
O,Yes opportunity cost meaning for every hour you spend on your sport .
O,You surrender in hour of something else .
O,For every opportunity the sport gives you there's another opportunity you have to sacrifice .
O,So fighting takes up a lot of time and you know fighters they have to diet pretty hard .
O,Lauren Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the flyweight division of the UFC .
O,They have to work out all the time and they also need to rest a lot of us work .
O,So there's just not a lot of time in the day and a lot of times the first thing that kind of gets taken off the plate is time with family .
O,And so I remember missing a couple Thanksgiving dinners .
O,You know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas .
O,And I remember my family kind of being like What the hell .
O,Why you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much .
O,And I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time .
O,I just thought this is something that I want to do and I want to be really good good at it while I do it .
O,And so I need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later in high school .
O,You know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance .
O,I started preparing the former baseball All-Star mark to Shaira .
O,I didn't go to my high school homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball .
O,You know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like 70 games every summer .
O,My friends were going to concerts my friends are you know having a good time at the beach and all these kind of things .
O,So for me I sacrificed from the time I was I don't know .
O,Probably in high school is when I started to forego other opportunities .
O,That again is Dominique Foxworth who overdid his push ups and sit ups at age 8 in order to make the NFL and then in college I wanted to be a computer science major at University of Maryland and my academic adviser was like though that course is going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah .
O,So I was like no not going to do that .
O,So instead you did was it American Studies and American studies in journalism and journalism which just shows how easy what I do is that you could do it in another major while playing football .
O,No I I enjoyed those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football .
O,And I say all that to say once I got to the league then I got drafted and I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money .
O,It doesn't make up for all the things that you've given up through the course of your life .
O,You shouldn't feel too sorry for Foxworth he played long enough to enter free agency .
O,His final NFL contract paid him about 27 million dollars .
O,But now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects of his single mindedness .
O,So like my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I worked towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would get me closer to that goal .
O,But give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends and including family and .
O,And then I was like I'm done playing .
O,So I will be in this state of transition .
O,His transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA Players Union .
O,He's now doing some writing and sportscasting .
O,I mean I think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly .
O,And it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and have fun with them .
O,But throughout my life I have been almost myopically focused on a goal which being focused on that goal gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the Nietzsche quote but it's something to the effect of when a man has a why he can bear almost any how .
O,And like I was I didn't .
O,I don't drink now .
O,Never drank in my life .
O,I never smoke weed like I was singularly focused on doing everything .
O,Every decision I made was like All right I'm going to get closer to his goal and I my the people I was close with in high school like those aren't my friends anymore .
O,People I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore .
O,And then at 35 and DC or my wife has a bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like .
O,And I'm like I don't really have that .
O,And like I was making these choices which I thought were choices to get me what you wanted .
O,Right .
O,And I didn't realize at the time that I was forgoing like lasting long lasting relationships .
O,And while you're a professional athlete you walk around with this skepticism frankly of all new people in your life .
O,So even if there were like the potential of some great friendships like I wasn't open to go to these places people oh football blared and I'd pretend and be nice to them because that's what you do and they pretend or whatever it be to me because that's what you do and then you move on and and then you're 35 and you're like Yeah I haven't talked to your best friend from high school in 10 years .
O,I mean I feel like I'm in a perpetual state of transition which is interesting and uncomfortable at the same time .
O,It's one thing if all the sacrifices all the opportunities for gone translate into a successful athletic career as it did for Dominique Foxworth Mark Teixeira and Lauren Murphy .
O,But what about the athletes who make the sacrifices but don't make the big time .
O,Just look at the numbers .
O,There are only about 7900 players in the NFL Major League Baseball .
O,There are fewer than 900 .
O,The NBA is about 500 .
O,In baseball roughly 90 percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors .
O,One of those 90 percent was Justin Humphries .
O,You get a phone call that says how does it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros .
O,And you just get you get .
O,It's a dream come true .
O,So I ended up signing he started playing minor league baseball at 18 which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on in 2009 .
O,He retired at age 27 without ever making the majors .
O,He enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh .
O,So I was sitting there in his classroom .
O,I started thinking about all the issues that I had seen in independent baseball and affiliated baseball guys living check to check strolling with which go back to school family life issues at home .
O,And I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and things that I was seeing and hearing were reflected in the numbers we followed a sample of the draft class of 2001 .
O,And so that's about 10 years .
O,And that is Sudhir Venkatesh and so we thought that would help us to understand what happens to these folks .
O,I think one of the most curious things that we find is how much 10 years matter .
O,So if you take two people who grew up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball and one didn't .
O,The person who plays baseball is making about 40 percent less on average 10 years after they enter the game than the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career .
O,All right .
O,So what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking the average player .
O,Probably looks like an upper middle class kid who comes out of college or comes out of high school .
O,And when you follow an upper middle class kid for about seven to 10 years they're probably going to make higher than the median average income .
O,They're probably not going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe .
O,They're going to have a career .
O,Now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid that kid looks like he's making about 20 to 24 thousand dollars a year which is not a lot of money .
O,He's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food .
O,Well when you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than 2000 dollars a month living off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that .
O,At some point you have to say look I've got no degree .
O,I had less than an associate's degree at that point .
O,So at some point you tell yourself I can't do this to myself I can't do this to my parents and I can't continue when I know there's an untapped potential to do other things .
O,Knowing when to quit anything is hard especially if it means abandoning a lifelong dream .
O,Quitting an athletic dream .
O,It's especially hard because baked into the ethos of sport is the idea that you should never quit never give up .
O,Never back down .
O,Think about it if you had been playing in the minor leagues or some equivalent for a decade .
O,When you really think your moment was ever going to come would you really think there was any chance at all .
O,Before you answer I'd like to introduce you to someone named Andre Ingram .
O,Hey Steve how are you doing man .
O,Sorry I'm late .
O,No no no .
O,No worries .
O,Let's talk a little bit about your background .
O,I believe you grew up in Richmond Virginia where you still live .
O,Is that right .
O,That's correct .
O,I'm curious is your family the same Ingram family of the gospel group The Ingrey met .
O,That's very good .
O,Yeah that's exactly correct .
O,That's my father's side .
O,And then tell me about you .
O,Are you musical or are you talented .
O,No .
O,So my brother and the athletes and it's funny because everyone else in our family is musically gifted in some way my brother and I we got none of that .
O,So yeah we just we got def Lettice .
O,Ingram was a good basketball player in high school and then played his college ball at American University a solid basketball program but hardly elite it had produced only one NBA player in its history .
O,Ingram was a three point shot specialist and he left America as its fifth leading all time score .
O,But that was not enough to get drafted into the NBA .
O,So he entered the NBA minor league which at the time was called the D league the standing for development .
O,Since change its name and a sponsorship deal to the league with the GI standing for Gatorade anyway Andre Ingram entered the D league with the hopes of being called up to the NBA .
O,He wound up staying for ten years .
O,Almost nobody stays in the league for ten years it pays so poorly .
O,Roughly twenty five thousand dollars a season the most young players give it a year or two before going to play pro in Europe or elsewhere .
O,Ingram tried Australia briefly didn't like it .
O,Plus he wanted to stay nearby just in case the NBA finally came calling .
O,There were many times where I was you know ready to just turn the other way and do something else .
O,You know .
O,Wife and Kids family you know the league really is not paying you much like you know you need to do something else like I came to that point so many times and you know something kept me going every time .
O,Last year he played for a team called the South Bay Lakers .
O,They're owned by the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers which you've probably heard of Ingram led the league in three point shooting percentage but still he was 32 years old by now and still in the league for extra money .
O,He tutored kids in math at the end of the season .
O,He was called in for his regular exit interview .
O,So you know I'm thinking all right this is you know the same old thing but then we get upstairs we get in this big conference room and not only is the GM and head coach there president is there and I'm like OK this is a bit different .
O,I've done this before and usually our president is not here the president he's talking about is the president of basketball operations not for the South Bay Lakers but for the Los Angeles Lakers .
O,Magic Johnson you've probably heard of him too .
O,So you know hard is kind of racing at that moment and then they tell me the news .
O,The news was that the L.A. Lakers with just two games left in their season were calling Andre Ingram up to play .
O,He would make his NBA debut at age 32 .
O,Everything that I was feeling is exactly what you thought or would anybody would think no one my story nor my situation .
O,I just didn't let it out like my wife and my mom did when I told you .
O,They let it out .
O,They just let it be raw and you know the real emotion that you know people love to see .
O,I was a little bit more of do but was feeling it all inside .
O,And so you know immediately after that though my first thought goes to OK you .
O,Who do we play again tomorrow .
O,They were playing the Houston Rockets late in the first quarter Ingram finally got his chance to play in the NBA .
O,Years .
O,After his professional career began .
O,Getting caught up by the Lakers .
O,You know I think before I got there in the night before was when all the emotions were running wild and I'm not sure how to feel and you're so excited yet nervous and all these other things .
O,But when it came time for the actual game it really turned into basketball very quickly for me and made things a whole lot easier .
O,How easy was it .
O,Well .
O,First .
O,Try .
O,Ingram scored 19 points at night including for three point shots .
O,It was one of the best debuts in Lakers history as one of the most amazing debuts ever .
O,The 32 year old rookie .
O,The crowd began chanting MVP MVP .
O,And .
O,Counting .
O,So we had no idea of the reach of this until my brother and my niece had called and told me they said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're blowing up my Instagram you know you're everywhere and you just have no idea .
O,So I know that you're great 3 point shooter .
O,Historically great .
O,So but forgive me for saying this your shot looks a little bit ugly and honest with you .
O,You know it's a little off balance and I know it works but I'm really curious to ask you I don't mean to insult you it's an insult with a question though I get it .
O,Do you think that maybe is part of what's kept teams in the past from giving you a shot at the NBA .
O,And I asked this thinking about the story about Jeremy Lin who so many teams overlooked and they later admitted they overlooked him because he was an Asian guy and he didn't fit the template of what you know an NBA player was and I'm curious if whether you think that your untraditional shop may have hurt you in some way even if just like perception wise .
O,You know what I mean it's a good question .
O,I don't think so .
O,I would say the gray hair probably has more to do with it .
O,If I had to guess maybe the awkwardness or the shot or not .
O,Not so much the awkwardness of it but the release point of it because it's a bit lower than most guys .
O,I'm already not the tallest guy so maybe there is worry about well hey this shot is going to get blocked in our league .
O,The guys are too athletic for him to get that off .
O,So maybe that was a maybe that was a thought to be honest with you .
O,All right .
O,So here's the big question what's your future .
O,Yes all right now my agent is in talks with you know different teams we're trying to get into a training camp right now .
O,That's the goal and you know hopefully there'll be some new soon where I'll be but nowhere yet .
O,So what happens if you know you don't get in a training camp .
O,You don't get to play for an NBA team .
O,What do you do this coming season .
O,Yeah we'll definitely be the league again .
O,You know it could be another season of it .
O,I mean the job for me is simple you know just stay ready .
O,But the goal is and we will be continuing to play that that much I can tell you .
O,It's interesting you know as a sports fan I've been you know my whole life seen people trying to squeeze meaning out of sports beyond the game itself .
O,And a lot of times it feels kind of forced .
O,But it strikes me that your story is really different .
O,What is the lesson that we maybe should take from your story .
O,What I would like for people to get out of it the most is that it wasn't just that you know I stuck with it all the way through and was happy about it all the time .
O,I definitely had doubts .
O,I had no disbelief I had discouragement .
O,You know you don't get to something or any dream or anything we're having just you know scot free .
O,But I think that part about it is the realest part .
O,Please join me in wishing Andre Ingram the best of luck whatever happens next .
O,To play us out today here's his family's gospel group .
O,Maggie Ingram and the Ingram Mets .
O,This song is called appropriately enough work until I die .
