O,"Well , Charlotte ."
O,"Really , was it a grueling week ?"
O,What's going on ?
O,"This week was really tough , but I do feel better ."
O,I had IVF this week .
O,"I don't know what that stands for , but ."
O,But I know I had it .
O,And then I .
O,"And then I you know , I had my egg retrieval on Monday ."
O,Uh-Huh .
O,Which is also the last time I pooped .
O,"I said I wasn't going to say it , but I did ."

O,And you've been sharing you this IVF journey on social media .
O,"Yes , I have been posting about IVF ."
O,"Yeah , I just thought I'll share it ."
O,Yeah .
O,Because one time we posted you were feeling run down and pretty emotional because because your hormones are like all over the place .
O,Right .
O,Yet they're still all over the place .
O,"So like , watch out ."
O,"I mean , it was really you get shot with a ton of hormones ."
O,"I still have my , you know , the bruises from where you get the shots ."
O,"I mean , it's I don't want to discourage anyone , but it hurts ."
O,Those shots hurt .
O,"And then you get to have the egg retrieval then after , you know , your ovaries are filling up with fluid ."
O,IVF guys .
O,"And during this time , I saw you posted where you were asking other people just to send me any advice you have about it ."
O,You give me advice .
O,"Well , you know , it's not something that there've been some people who've been really open about it ."
O,I know Gabrielle Union head and just people who've they've shared their journeys with it .
O,But I didn't really have like a big group to ask about it .
O,"So I was like , yeah , why don't I ask everybody ?"
O,"See , we don't get all the tips just like you guys have ."
O,Right .
O,For for WW I .
O,"I use my Instagram and and asked like , what should I know ?"
O,What what do you wish you knew ?
O,And men like .
O,Women were just really down to it to reach out and share and help me and like hold my hand through it .
O,I love that you came in your sweats .
O,"So Amy sent me a text earlier and said , this is OK to wear ."
O,I go .
O,You should wear whatever makes you feel comfortable .
O,Yeah .
O,And you were having a stylist come over .
O,They were gonna do the whole dress thing .
O,I got a dress .
O,You gotta dress hanging up in my closet .
O,I said just .
O,"I said , it's Charlotte ."
O,They're gonna love you just the way I know .
O,I do love Charlotte .
O,I've performed here a lot .
O,Really ?
O,"Yeah , mostly for the Hornets , but also I perform stand up ."
O,My husband won't watch this .
O,"You know , I ."
O,And I just eat some biscuits backstage .
O,I will change your life .
O,"Yeah , the food here ."
O,It's not as though you don't do the point thing or anything .
O,"No , I use all my points on these biscuits ."
O,I was gonna say cause a biscuit can take you down .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,Now you said that this whole process has taught you to actually be more patient and kind with yourself .
O,What does that look like for you ?
O,Patients in kindness showing up for yourself ?
O,"I think as as women , I know there are men here , too ."
O,And I don't want to alienate you .
O,"But I think as women , the the expectations on us are so high to always be okay ."
O,Always look your best .
O,Feel your .
O,"But you know , and ."
O,And so I what am I talking about ?
O,"You're talking about this process of being kinder to yourself , kinder to myself ."
O,OK .
O,"You know , when you're talking and then you look out and you're like , there are truly 15000 people here ."
O,"And Oprah , I'm like at my high ."
O,"I'm not high , but I'm like , I think I'm high ."
O,"It's really easy to be to feel guilty all the time , especially now having a baby like just that self guilt , the self-hate ."
O,"And it can get to me , too ."
O,And what do you say to your friends ?
O,"You know , like give yourself the advice , you give your friends ."
O,Love yourself like you're your own mother .
O,"You know , like be kind to yourself , kind to say , you know ."
O,"So just it's that those feelings of guilt , they're useless and they're not real and ."
O,"Do you have them now as a as a new mother , like , are you doing it right ?"
O,Do you have those ?
O,Am I doing it right ?
O,"Yeah , it's ."
O,"And you know , and I'm working and like I know there's working mom vibes out in this audience ."
O,It's it's a constant .
O,There's a constant .
O,Like just cycle of of guilt and shame about it .
O,"You're like , should I be with my baby all the time ?"
O,Like somebody else is taking care of my child right now .
O,"But really , what I've learned for myself is like the best thing you can do is to take care of yourself so that when you show up for your kids ."
O,"Yeah , you are ."
O,So your version of yourself .
O,Absolutely .
O,No question .
O,"But I do love the fact that you said , look , I'm going to come ."
O,I'm going to do this for you and then I'm going to go right out .
O,I'm not even going to wait to say goodbye to you backstage .
O,And you believe it .
O,"I'm not going to say goodbye to , you know ."
O,So let's just do it now .
O,Bye bye .
O,It was so good seeing you .
O,You look amazing .
O,So much .
O,Thank you for coming .
O,Thank you .
O,Yeah .
O,You said your hope now .
O,So the reason you're going through all this IVF is so that you can have a sibling for Gene .
O,"Yeah , because you thought just having one would not suffice ."
O,No .
O,"Having and if you want to have one kid , do you know Presh ?"
O,I think I think my husband really wanted us to have another one because we love him so much .
O,I think he thinks that it's creepy .
O,You know what I mean ?
O,"Like you're just obsessed , you know , and he thinks like , you gonna have another one so that you're not you don't make him into like a complete weirdo ."
O,"I you know , I'm really close with my sister ."
O,"And so we were like , we gotta try we got to try to get a sibling ."
O,"And so you had a really , really difficult pregnancy ."
O,"I mean , not just Mortensen's , but morning sickness every day , like ."
O,Yeah .
O,Calling me from different states .
O,Like I have connections .
O,Yeah .
O,"I was like calling you like come in to see , you know , a doctor , you know , someone who can give me an I.V. in Chicago ."
O,Hi .
O,I'm on the floor .
O,"Yeah , it was ."
O,"I had hyperemesis , which I also have endometriosis ."
O,"And , you know , it's a lot ."
O,There's not a lot of research on these these women's issues because that's what they are .
O,They're women .
O,"I mean , they now have chewable Viagra , but they can't throw us a bone with endometriosis ."
O,"Give some money to the studies for ladies also , please ."
O,"But yeah , I was so sick ."
O,I was .
O,I couldn't keep anything down .
O,I was hospitalized four times .
O,Four times .
O,"Like , you know ."
O,"Were you really afraid , though , during that time ?"
O,Because you're thinking .
O,"I you know , I could lose this baby ."
O,One in three women with hyperemesis lose the baby .
O,"Oh , and something like 50 percent lose their jobs ."
O,You can't work .
O,It's the if you've ever had food poisoning .
O,It's that I had that for nine and a half months .
O,"Cause , you know , you're not pregnant for nine months ."
O,That is a lie .
O,"I don't know why they say nine months , nine months ."
O,"And you start doing the math and you know , it's 10 months at least ."
O,Right .
O,"I mean , it really is ."
O,And I heard that one of your takeaways from all of this was that women are just .
O,"Warriors , we are warriors ."
O,All of us .
O,"I mean , for real ."
O,That is what I learned .
O,I didn't just learn how strong I was .
O,I really learned as a whole how strong women are .
O,"And , you know , men are great , too ."
O,"And like , that's awesome ."
O,"And you guys can , like , throw a touchdown ."
O,"But like , can you make a baby ?"
O,We can make a baby with our body .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,It's growing .
O,"And they know football's great , but like make a baby ."
O,It's pretty amazing when you think about .
O,It's amazing to me .
O,And just the pain everybody in the room made a baby .
O,Give yourself a high five .
O,Look at your .
O,"So you're you're pretty much an open book on social media , particularly your posts about being a new mom ."
O,I enjoyed your hospital underwear photo .
O,"Oh , good ."
O,I was hoping this would come up again .
O,Woo hoo .
O,"Look , do that ."
O,Why do you like it so much ?
O,Why do I love those underwear ?
O,Yeah .
O,"Oh , my God , they're a dream ."
O,"Well , you know how like we're supposed to be able to put on like my my friend Mia Jackson , a hilarious comedian , as a joke about this guy ."
O,Sorry .
O,"Take in , Mary ."
O,"Sorry , my friend Mia has a joke about that ."
O,"Like girls are supposed to look cute in their , like , boyfriends clothes ."
O,"Yeah , but she's really tall and so she's like , it just fits ."
O,Right .
O,"And for me , it's like I never feel the underwear ."
O,I'm always like .
O,I guess I'll go up a size .
O,"But , you know , when you put on some big underwear , you feel like I'm a little baby , I'm little , you know , I'm drowning in his underwear ."
O,So that underwear makes me feel really good about myself .
O,"Tussock also , I think , is this a way of you sort of diffusing the fame and remaining authentic these kinds of posts , I think ?"
O,Is that embarrassing for you ?
O,I think so .
O,"You know , being authentic is has become the most important thing to me ."
O,Yeah .
O,"And I think with it with social media , you know , we follow people home and they're just like , look how perfect ."
O,"And no offense , because I'm guessing that this is an audience that sends out Christmas cards ."
O,"But like like I know your Christmas cards are hanging in everyone's house , but I'm like , you know , I want to see a little bit more of the truth ."
O,"You know , don't show me your family on your best day ."
O,Like what ?
O,What's really going on ?
O,"And I did you know , I grew up with like a very broken home ."
O,And I I didn't feel like that perfection .
O,"And and rather than feeling bad about it , I just wanted to share it , because I think a lot of people can relate ."
O,And everybody is going through their own hard time .
O,"And you don't seem to you know , I'm really interested in this whole subject of shame and how that that holds us back ."
O,You don't seem to have any .
O,"Yeah , I think that's great ."
O,"You know , you pose nude and then you laugh about how everyone says , oh , how brave you are to my you know , to be honest , I ."
O,So you get a lot of advice when you're pregnant .
O,Everybody wants to tell you .
O,"And I think they have good intentions , but a lot of it's pretty pushy ."
O,"And so people say to you , you know , do whatever you want if you want , have a C-section , you want it natural , whatever you want ."
O,Do you ?
O,"But really , their subtext is like try to have a natural birth ."
O,"You better push that baby out with no drugs , you know ?"
O,And so and then I was getting advice like prenatal yoga really helps .
O,And so I immediately signed up for a C-section .
O,I'm not .
O,You'll never see me .
O,Never .
O,I did .
O,But I had a C-section .
O,"I opted for a C-section , which , you know , that just can really be ."
O,I did .
O,I came out the sunroof and I I was so sick for so long .
O,"And I knew because of endometriosis , I probably wasn't going to be able to have him vaginally ."
O,And and some women can feel like you've failed .
O,"I've heard people say that if you have a C-section , they feel like you failed because there's a lot you were saying you never recognized that before , that there was so much judgment ."
O,"I know you went back to work after Jean was born and then people like , oh , you're going back to work ."
O,Yeah .
O,What are you doing ?
O,You should be home with the baby .
O,"And I was like , they're probably right ."
O,I was really too vulnerable to be on stage .
O,But .
O,"But with things like that and with breastfeeding , again , it's like breastfeed until you have that ."
O,Give him the left .
O,"And again , people go whatever if you want to ."
O,"But really , the subtext is you better feed him with your boobs like you better ."
O,But I it wasn't right for our family .
O,It wasn't it was it was too much on me .
O,And I wasn't .
O,And I was feeling starting to feel bad .
O,And I was like .
O,"And it occurred to me , I can stop breastfeeding ."
O,And Serena Williams gave me great advice on great formula .
O,"And also , you know , like the greatest generation was raised on for me , like people have been fine on formula ."
O,"And he's so healthy , so good ."
O,And .
O,Yeah .
O,And that pressure is real .
O,And but what I realized was that it was self-inflicted .
O,I'm not trying to vilify the other women that said that said these things to me .
O,It's going to happen .
O,You're going to feel all these pressures and about a lot of different things about being a mom or just being a woman .
O,"But if you let it get to you , that's on you ."
O,"Like , I had to stop and say , no , this is all self-inflicted ."
O,I'm gonna get rid of this guilt and do what's right for me and my family .
O,And what makes me feel healthy .
O,That means you're a different kind of woman .
O,That's a different that to me is what a real feminist is .
O,"I know you have your own ideas about it , right ?"
O,I've tried to do that with my friends who are pregnant now .
O,"You know , just like ."
O,Really ?
O,"And and also , don't ask people even asking , are you gonna breastfeed ?"
O,What do you .
O,Don't worry about who's eating from her breasts .
O,Leave her alone .
O,Stay in your own lane .
O,"Just say , I hope you're healthy and you feel good and and you're doing whatever you need to to take care of your ."
O,So you're able to take the stuff that would embarrass .
O,"I think most people and to turn it into not only a badge of courage , but even me could make a joke about it sometimes , right ?"
O,That's true .
O,I can't help it .
O,I .
O,It's .
O,"And I think we've talked about it a little bit before , but it is a little bit of a start as a defense mechanism ."
O,Yeah .
O,And then I just I realize it really does make me feel better and it makes other people feel better .
O,You know this criticism ever get to you ?
O,Yeah .
O,"Yeah , yeah ."
O,"But not I mean , not about my looks when I I mean , I've been trolled on the Internet for so long ."
O,I'm actually like worried because I haven't been trolled that much lately .
O,"Like , where are they ?"
O,"Like , did they grow up ?"
O,"And like , did I hope they grew up eating our families and they found some peace ."
O,But like I haven't been .
O,I was so trolled for so long .
O,And where are the trolls ?
O,Like I need to hire the time .
O,Did you make sure they're OK ?
O,Did you start making fun of yourself so that because it was sort of a defense mechanism I on us .
O,"I think when I was younger like that , you know , I was definitely bullied and shocking ."
O,Every comedian like you'll never meet a comedian .
O,He was like .
O,It was all good .
O,Like it was good .
O,I'm just happy .
O,I was really bullied .
O,And and also I still feels way if I think everyone in a room is thinking something .
O,I want to be the one to say it .
O,"You know , that makes you feel like you have a certain power ."
O,But I don't really do that .
O,That's what the good comedians can do .
O,Yeah .
O,Used to kind of diffuse the room by saying the thing we're all thinking .
O,But I asked Tina Fey this last week and I answer surprised me .
O,Is there anything that should be off limits to making a joke about .
O,Yeah .
O,What did she say ?
O,I thought she said no .
O,She's had no .
O,"Well , she's an evil person ."
O,And I'm glad that we finally learned that about Tina Fey .
O,I was Tina actually gave me a joke to say what she said .
O,"Well , she said she had so much fun with you , first of all ."
O,And she said that this event is should be called Coachella .
O,Coachella .
O,We'll take it .
O,That's pretty good .
O,"Pretty good , Tina ."
O,"Yeah , but I do think some things are off limits ."
O,I do .
O,And I know that because I have said those jokes .
O,It doesn't feel good .
O,It honestly just doesn't feel good like I did .
O,I used to do roasts .
O,I was in the Comedy Central roasts and a one person thing .
O,"And I realize , like , you know , you think , oh , no , nobody gets their feelings hurt ."
O,It's a roast as we're supposed to do .
O,But no people .
O,That hurts your feelings .
O,And I've had my feelings hurt .
O,And so I don't want to hurt people's feelings .
O,"So if I think that there's someone out there and it's going to hurt their feelings , I'm not going to say it anymore ."
O,That's really good .
O,"Yeah , I think that's good ."
O,"Makes me feel better , I guess ."
O,"Whatever community , whatever you want to do ."
O,But I think there's some off limits .
O,"Earlier today , I was sharing the story about how getting pneumonia actually helped me be happier and more grateful for the body that I have ."
O,And last year you said filming the movie .
O,I feel pretty actually push you to do the work to fall in love with yourself .
O,Thank you .
O,I love that movie .
O,Thank you .
O,Just this row .
O,I thought that was a really great movie .
O,Thank you .
O,The critics now that we're talking about .
O,"No , I ."
O,"Yeah , that was it ."
O,"But also about criticism , I just want to say that I have learned from from it ."
O,"Also , there are you can't you can't say , oh , they're always wrong , like I have learned from good critics ."
O,"You know , there are some really talented critics out there ."
O,But I learned to fall in love with myself during I feel pretty because being on camera and being right out the gate asked to lose weight and whatever .
O,"And like Tina , like , you know , I went to some people like , can you believe they wanted to lose weight for this thing ?"
O,"And they go , just lose weight and you go , all right , you know ."
O,"But for me , the way I was losing weight to be in the movie Trainwreck ."
O,Wait for it .
O,So rude .
O,Just move .
O,I was hungry .
O,OK .
O,Like hungry .
O,I was hungry .
O,There was not .
O,"You know , and my friends are actresses who are like , no , like , I found this ."
O,"I'm like , well , for me , like , I'm I don't want to be hungry ."
O,And I was hungry .
O,And then I did something .
O,I .
O,"And this is a sacrilege , I think , to WW ."
O,I'm not sure .
O,But I I haven't weighed myself in like eight years .
O,"Like , I don't know ."
O,I don't know what those numbers are .
O,I couldn't even begin to tell you .
O,And being pregnant and not knowing your weight .
O,Like every time then or what do you weigh ?
O,"And I'm like , I don't know ."
O,"And they're like , what do you mean ?"
O,Do you have a ballpark ?
O,"I'm like , I've no idea ."
O,"Like , your guess is as good as mine ."
O,Why is that ?
O,I .
O,Because it I don't .
O,"Because for me , knowing that number , like I would get obsessed with it ."
O,And so not even think about the number .
O,Thinking about how I feel and knowing I'm writing nourishing foods in my body .
O,That's great .
O,And exercising like I don't need those numbers to tell me .
O,That's how I feel .
O,"For me , that's what's right ."
O,It's great .
O,Everyone is different doing me .
O,But I wanted to with .
O,I feel pretty .
O,I wanted to get to a place .
O,And I wanted to be teaching people to love the skin that you're in right now .
O,Love this .
O,Here today .
O,Version of yourself .
O,Don't be .
O,"You know , we're all striving for something ."
O,But .
O,"But , but love yourself right here and right now ."
O,"Like the skin you're in without being like , oh , if I can just get that , then I'll be able to love my myself when the win win ."
O,Yeah .
O,So you've been married now two years ?
O,Yes .
O,Yes .
O,Is it everything you thought it would be or more ?
O,It's better .
O,I really .
O,I never wanted to get married .
O,I never wanted kids .
O,"I didn't even think about it like I you know , kid , like little girls play wedding ."
O,I was like playing that .
O,I was a fortune teller .
O,"You know , like Madam Levitsky , you know , like I was wasn't playing characters ."
O,But then I met this dude .
O,"And I was like , I want to partner up with you for life ."
O,And I do want to get the government involved .
O,And I .
O,I want you to sign .
O,I want to make a vow .
O,"Everyone here heard you , and now you are mine ."
O,I we fell in love .
O,And I could see what that partnership would look like .
O,And I .
O,"Yeah , I felt and I heard your writing was pretty ."
O,Her Lowery's switch was clear from the moment .
O,"There was a man dressed as a woman who officiated and began with , dearly beloved and Seth Meyers ."
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,"Hey , you separated Seth Meyers from the dearly beloved ."
O,Yeah .
O,With Seth Meyers was there .
O,We had a really fun last minute wedding and we were just like we wanted to be married .
O,"That's why , you know , he didn't want to , like , plan a wedding for a long time ."
O,"We were like , we just want to be married ."
O,So we sort of got it out of the way .
O,And how did you know that Chris was the one for you ?
O,"His confidence , his self-assuredness that he was so confident about us , too ."
O,I just loved him like I and I just liked him .
O,One night we just sat there .
O,We we're just friends first for like six months and we were just sitting there watching old episodes of Arrested Development .
O,"And yeah , and we were reading there's like a part , you know , The New Yorker shouts and murmurs and he was like reading me one of his favorite ones ."
O,And we were just we just laughed at the same stuff .
O,We like the same stuff .
O,And .
O,And he's hot .
O,And I wanted to tap that .
O,Did you say that ?
O,I'd like to apologize .
O,"Oh , but you know what he said to me ?"
O,"We were you know , I don't know if you were ever like this ."
O,"Well , I do know you were like this ."
O,And I think a lot of us could identify with this .
O,"Like when you start liking someone , you feelings , you are afraid of getting hurt ."
O,So you just don't you want to just like either sabotage it right away or just know how it's going to end right away .
O,Right .
O,"You know , like where we're used to some level of control ."
O,So what's going to happen here ?
O,And so I was texting him early on early .
O,"So I said , well , I just hope , you know , I don't know if I want kids ."
O,"So if that's something you're looking for , I don't know if that's gonna be me ."
O,"And he said , I wrote that right back ."
O,"He said , I do want kids and I want them with you ."
O,"And when we have a family , this is where dating for like three months at this point ."
O,And we'll have a beautiful family .
O,And I can't wait .
O,What did you do ?
O,I know right where I was standing in my closet .
O,"I like just I had to , like , hold the wall ."
O,"I was like , hold on a minute ."
O,Pause .
O,"You know , you just see yourself three months in because three months you still ."
O,Jim .
O,"Yeah , but it was easy right away ."
O,It makes when I feel like when you find the person .
O,Yup .
O,That you want to be with .
O,It's it's exactly .
O,It's not .
O,And during your do your Netflix special growing in twenty nineteen .
O,Yeah .
O,Yes .
O,Thank you .
O,Growing Netflix .
O,Netflix .
O,You shared that that Chris was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder .
O,I saying it correct .
O,Yeah .
O,r_s_t_ autism spectrum disorder .
O,To say that all of the characteristics that actually make it clear that he is on the spectrum are the things that make you love him so much .
O,Yeah .
O,Like what ?
O,"Well , he's so direct ."
O,"I mean , like I was about to leave this morning ."
O,Yeah .
O,"And I'm like , you know , the car's there and I'm like , is this okay ?"
O,"And he goes , well , it's really too late ."
O,He was right .
O,It was too late .
O,It was too late .
O,And he'll do .
O,"I mean , he will just say things to people and not know that he just like completely crushed them ."
O,And his honesty is so beautiful to me .
O,"And it's kind of like no filter , no filter , no one which could be heard ."
O,It could be challenging at times also .
O,"But it's also super power where I think , you know , he like now people know he has autism ."
O,"So which which I think is the benefit was one of the benefits of being diagnosed as people don't make him feel like he's bad or wrong , like he is different brain chemistry ."
O,"And I think , you know , are a child being diagnosed could you know , instead of it being about the stigma of it , it could help them feel like they're not bad ."
O,Yeah .
O,Yes .
O,Thank you .
O,Yes .
O,"I wish that was I wish he'd been I wish he'd been tested at a younger age , because I think it also makes a lot of people around you stressed and upset with you ."
O,And it's not their fault .
O,Right .
O,You said his superpower .
O,What's yours ?
O,"Oh , I can do like a ton of drop ."
O,"No , he's going to be fine ."
O,No .
O,Did you say that your dream in life is to get it ?
O,We both have a dream in life .
O,Yeah .
O,And that is to get Gail to smoke weed .
O,To smoke weed .
O,"We're looking at you , Gail , we're talking about wellness today , right ?"
O,Yes .
O,No .
O,"And all the animals in all the years that I've been besties with Gail and that's since nineteen seventy six and between segments and sixteen eighty five in all those years , neither he nor Gail has ever had a sip of anything ."
O,And Gail still thinks weed is a marijuana cigarette .
O,Well Gail if you ever smoke weed and she's like no I never had a marijuana cigarette .
O,Well I guess not .
O,"If you're calling it a marijuana cigarette , you know , it's never nice to drug someone ."
O,And I'm very against that .
O,"Yes , but if we could do it all would be just around ."
O,Just one one time .
O,And then we'll Instagram it so y'all can see .
O,Great .
O,"I think women I think , you know , in terms of all the things out there , weed is on the more harmless level and can really help ."
O,The least we could do is give us some CBD oil .
O,Give her a CBD gummy .
O,"I mean , the other day I was just like , Gil , just take it ."
O,"It's gonna be great cause she's like these bad knees I go , it's gonna be great for your knees ."
O,I don't know if I want marijuana on my knees .
O,Poor Gail .
O,"Yeah , we just want to haze her ."
O,OK .
O,So how does being married to a chef work ?
O,Does it mean he's fixing fancy things for you all the time ?
O,"I want to say no , because you guys won't hate me ."
O,"But yes , like every night , bitches , I'm telling you ."
O,It's true .
O,It's amazing .
O,"Whoever you're with , dump them and find a chef ."
O,"It's just true , and he's you know , he grew up on Martha's Vineyard and he was all about like real farm to table ."
O,Yeah .
O,Yes .
O,So he's it's just really nourishing great foods .
O,And our son is loving all .
O,You don't cook for him .
O,"No , he doesn't stand there and tell me jokes ."
O,"You know , he ."
O,Good .
O,"Good , good , good , good ."
O,We stay in our lane .
O,"So great , so great ."
O,"Have you ever , like , really tanked on stage , we were like , oh , my God ."
O,Yes .
O,"In this state , like I've definitely I've found all over the country ."
O,I did .
O,I really have .
O,And we have to do bad .
O,You have to do .
O,But .
O,You have to do bad .
O,To do better .
O,You have to .
O,"I mean , that's you really you need ."
O,Yeah .
O,You need those low lows to appreciate the highs .
O,And what do they teach you ?
O,"Well , first of all , when you're first just you're not doing well in standup ."
O,The instinct is to like just go to the next joke and hope that goes better and you're really needy in the crowd .
O,"And , you know , you can feel the difference of when someone is talking to you and you feel at ease ."
O,Yeah .
O,Versus when you feel bad for them .
O,"So you just have to realize all your fears on stage , like everything happened to me , you know , like Pete , like somebody charge the stage me threw a bottle at me ."
O,"You know , it was like , oh , so everything has happened ."
O,"You know , I performed at a hunger strike by accident ."
O,I had all my worst fears came true onstage .
O,You know ?
O,"It's like boxing , it's like you're afraid of getting hit ."
O,Then you get hit so much you're not afraid of it anymore .
O,And that's how it is with standup .
O,I'm big .
O,I have no fears anymore because they all came true .
O,"You know , and yeah , you just get more confident , you just get better ."
O,You got to .
O,"You know , you get better off when you work hard ."
O,"There's no one there's no exception to that , you know ?"
O,Not at all .
O,None of us .
O,So .
O,"Oh , but you asked me backstage ."
O,I wanted to tell you .
O,"Yeah , a couple of comedians , because sometimes people will say to me , you're my favorite female comedian ."
O,"And I say , OK , who's your favorite male comedian ?"
O,"And then they go , I don't know ."
O,"I go , well , maybe I'm just your favorite comedian ."
O,"You know , like you don't say , oh , you're my favorite female chef ."
O,"Like , you can just say the thing ."
O,So but I did want to list Mia Jackson .
O,Aaron Jackson .
O,Chelsea Peretti .
O,Marina Franklin .
O,Janelle James .
O,Rachel Feinstein .
O,Bridget Averett .
O,Check them all out because you will laugh as my favorite comics .
O,Yeah .
O,Wow .
O,Those names .
O,Yeah .
O,OK .
O,"Yeah , say it again ."
O,"Mia Jackson , Aaron Jackson not related ."
O,Janelle James .
O,Rachel Feinstein .
O,Bridget Everett .
O,Marina Franklin .
O,OK .
O,"So I was going to ask Chelsea Peretti , what is the thing that never fails to make you laugh ?"
O,Aside from those comedians .
O,"Oh , gosh , something that never fails to make me laugh ."
O,"Well , I would say ."
O,It's cheesy .
O,My baby .
O,Yeah .
O,Who cares ?
O,"Amy , shut up ."
O,Do you know immediately when you have written something funny or do you have to tested tardo ?
O,I will .
O,Sometimes I'll really think I've got something .
O,"Got something cookin , you know , and I'll call my sister ."
O,I always call her first .
O,"And sometimes she just says , no , she'll go no by ."
O,Or and she never laughs .
O,"Actually , now that I'm thinking about it , you know , she'll just go ."
O,That's funny .
O,"I'm like , well , then why are you laughing ?"
O,Your body is supposed to have a reaction to that .
O,But no .
O,"Like I was when I was on to this last tour , I was pregnant ."
O,And so I came up with the line and I'll just kind of say it around her and see .
O,"And I said , you know , you when you're pregnant , you're still you you know , you're still working and traveling and drinking , you know ?"
O,And she really laughed at that .
O,"And I said , well , it's gone in yet ."
O,So do you think you're born this way funny or is it a funny gene or does it come from other stuff ?
O,I do think here you're born with it .
O,I think you've got that something that people can just see you and kind of start laughing .
O,Yeah .
O,You know what I mean ?
O,"Like , you just walk out and like , people just kind of ."
O,"There's some artists like that where you just you see their face , you just laugh and ."
O,"But I think if you work hard at anything , you get better at it ."
O,"So if you're not funny , I think you can work out how to be a better standup ."
O,But do you think you could be close to someone who wasn't funny ?
O,"Close , close ."
O,Yes .
O,"I mean , in other words , is there is lack of a sense of humor ."
O,A dealbreaker and not as close as I can be to someone who's funny or even just a great Laffer .
O,"Yeah , you know , but I have to be able to say any sick joke I want around them to feel really close to that ."
O,We're talking about Chris cooking .
O,"Are , you know , your best friends ?"
O,"You want to say like disgusting star , you always joking at home ?"
O,We're always playing at home .
O,We joke a lot .
O,We don't we do laugh .
O,It's a lot of play .
O,"But yeah , Chris and I , we did ."
O,"So it's a lot of joke , actually ."
O,We've been roleplaying .
O,And then .
O,"But my thing splitting yourself is it's not a wellness day , but I always do this ."
O,I just always go .
O,OK .
O,I'm in a coma .
O,That's how that's my sex role play .
O,I just .
O,I'm the laziest person you'll ever meet .
O,"You can't really like , you know , if you're married to someone , you've been with them forever , you keep ."
O,I find that it's like you can't really talk dirty anymore .
O,"It's like , oh , I'm going to do this to you ."
O,"He's like , no , you're not ."
O,"No , he knows ."
O,And then you see that you want to be disgusting and exactly what you mean .
O,"You know , I know I know exactly what you mean ."
O,This is like 7 .
O,"I've been together about 10 years and I was I'd done some show and someone was talking about , you know , how to entice your manners on ."
O,And he comes home and I'm like in this black negligee thing on the stairs .
O,"And he Louis walks by and says , What are you doing ?"
O,"Emma , anyway , so I get exactly ."
O,Just it made me cry .
O,"So , buddy , so you're like , what do you pay taxes ?"
O,"Oh , it's her ."
O,It's him .
O,He got it .
O,Yes .
O,It's so vulnerable to do that .
O,Yes .
O,So do you have it ?
O,"You know , we're all we're committing to a vision ."
O,Yeah .
O,Do you have one now that you have a family ?
O,"What I love is that whether you know it or not , every person has a dream for their family ."
O,And a lot of people haven't articulated that dream .
O,"I think people are just working towards , you know , making their families work ."
O,What is that would be another thing to include in your vision .
O,What's the dream for your family ?
O,Will you share that ?
O,I will .
O,And that is such a beautiful question .
O,I also .
O,"But before that dream for my family , like my dream for myself , is that I poop today ."
O,I .
O,Because it's been a Sunday or my can't even tell you .
O,"It's like , can the camera see this ?"
O,It's just look at that .
O,It's just sitting there .
O,Right .
O,It's not right .
O,I know .
O,And I already have an insidious idea tips like any something that's been since Sunday or Monday .
O,"It's been since Monday , since Monday , Monday , Monday ."
O,"And this is Saturday , Saturday ."
O,How am I even here right now ?
O,I don't owe .
O,I know and I know you're all thinking .
O,"I've already tried everything , I've tried prunes ."
O,I didn't have smooth move .
O,T But I'm going to .
O,But I was scared if I had it that it would hit right while I was here .
O,And that's not part of anyone's vision for 2020 .
O,True that it's true that .
O,True that .
O,OK .
O,OK .
O,When I think of my vision for my family .
O,It is also like .
O,"I love how hard life becomes like it wasn't even your vision , you know ."
O,"Yeah , I ."
O,"While we're talking about poop , I just have to say , like , never did I ."
O,"Like , right now most of my day is me cleaning poop off the tiniest pair of balls you've ever seen in your life just with a little cotton swab ."
O,That was not on my vision board .
O,What I see from my family .
O,What I want .
O,"What I wish for , what I see is ."
O,And then I'm going to take steps toward my intention .
O,Is is health keeping us all as healthy as possible ?
O,I really hope our family grows .
O,And IVF is going to .
O,Yeah .
O,Through for you .
O,Yes .
O,Do you want one to two more ?
O,"I definitely am hoping for two , too ."
O,"And , you know , maybe more ."
O,"I mean , once you have like I really have had a beautiful experience having a baby ."
O,"You know , it's different for everybody ."
O,But I I really have to recommend if you've got the resources to have a baby .
O,To have a baby .
O,It's been so Life-Changing for me .
O,And I really like the guy .
O,"And I mean , I picture us all on the beach together ."
O,And teaching maybe a little girl how to play volleyball .
O,I hope that vision comes .
O,"Me , too ."
O,I'm going to try .
