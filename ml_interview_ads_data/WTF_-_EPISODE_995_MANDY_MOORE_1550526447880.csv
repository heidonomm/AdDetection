O,How's everybody doing .
O,Are you OK .
O,It's a little tricky .
O,These these next couple of shows .
O,Well this show and Thursday were pre-recorded last week because my my business partner and a genius producer Mr. Brandon MacDonald is taking a well-deserved vacation .
O,So .
O,So we had to get these in the can .
O,The only reason I'm bringing it up is because of the Buster Keaton arc .
O,The emergency of his illness is now is now an arc .
O,Things are better with Buster and I'll tell you about that .
O,I do want to say this .

O,Anything you want to know anything you want to say anything I can maybe tell you .
O,Just anything .
O,As we head into this big show the thousandth show .
O,So did I mention that Mandy Moore is here today .
O,What a charming woman .
O,She came with cookies .
O,She came with fucking cookies and you know I'm a little I've been a little crazy with the diet and I think it's funny she brought a box of cookies I didn't even realize what they were .
O,I just kind of was like Oh my God .
O,Fuck yeah .
O,Why thank you .
O,And then I went .
O,After she left I realized they were a mirror cookies which are healthier .
O,And I put him in a freezer and got to be honest with you .
O,I had Mandy Moore on like it's been a couple of weeks and I only eight two of them .
O,And then just you know not even a day off .
O,I put him in the freezer as I said and then what you do is you stick him in the warming up and just put an oven like the little oven on warm put him in there for five minutes and it's like they're fresh out of the oven and I hate those fuckers .
O,The weird thing is that I don't know maybe it's because I'm eating so clean I eat one cookie the next day I felt I got four beers I was hung over .
O,Does that does that thing that happens .
O,Kind of fucked me up a little bit a little bit .
O,So Buster Keaton as you know the last you heard unless you're on Twitter you know he was in the hospital and it was not looking great .
O,He had the kidney failure .
O,And then I ended up getting an ultrasound and then I ended up getting a cancer test the day of both of those things his numbers had come down a lot but the vet that I went to she was like yeah these numbers that came down but don't get excited .
O,It's probably just the fluids .
O,I don't know .
O,So we did these other tests but it just like was just a bummer .
O,And I was gonna leave in there for two two more nights because I don't give a fuck about money apparently because I love this little cat and I don't have kids I don't have a wife I don't have debt and I'm not a big spender so we're gonna save a little fucking buster if we can .
O,That's the way this is going to work .
O,So the next day just to you know I locked into this idea that she was just basically telling me that there is no hope for this cat and I and I thought I'd been in denial .
O,Yeah I was in one of the stages of grief so that you know the day the morning of the ultrasound and ultimately the genetic cancer test she calls and she's like these numbers are great they're almost normal now .
O,I don't know .
O,And I'm like well what do you mean like I don't know .
O,They're almost normal .
O,We're going to let him out today and he doesn't have cancer .
O,So I brought him home .
O,I went down there I picked him up I brought him home IV cat kidney food for him and I've got subcutaneous fluids .
O,I have to a skin pop my cat .
O,I got it .
O,I got to shoot up my cat and more I got to get him an I.V. drip going into him for a little bit of water fluids .
O,So that was a new experience .
O,He we're learning new things .
O,I can .
O,You know it's funny when you have to do something you've never done like that before and you've got to stick a needle into a cat and sit there with it while this fluid drips in .
O,I get in the right mindset .
O,I'm more like it's weird what I learn about my brain is that like I do prepare I may not write things down but in my mind I'm like OK you know get a plan how you know you know how to do this you were shown how to do this just do it be confident about it be you know be present and do it and that and that's sort of like I do that a lot .
O,And I don't really realize it .
O,I don't know if that's preparedness .
O,But but like I gotta get myself psyched up I guess everybody does where I'm like you know don't doubt yourself just do it just put the needle in if something fucks up it fucks up you're not going to kill the cat unless you know you do something insanely stupid like jammin into his skull so I gave him the fluids but he's eating like mad because he hasn't eaten in days and he's he's he's very excited and happy and rubbing his head on everything and purring and again by the time you hear this a lot of days have gone by but this is what's happening so this is where you're checking in and I don't know what's going to happen hopefully progress will continue and you know that's good news I really thought he was a goner .
O,I'd really gotten into my head that I was going to have to put him down or I was going to bring him home and he was gonna be incredibly compromised .
O,Now granted this is only day one of him being home so we'll see what happens .
O,But yeah I'm cautiously optimistic .
O,So the Buster emergency situation has been downgraded now to an ark .
O,But either way it's just interesting with veterinarians with regular doctors how much they don't know .
O,And you know what .
O,Anyone out an animals going to do human or non-human and just that and we don't know if it was a toxic thing or infection but I guess what it isn't it seems is chronic renal failure .
O,Not today not today .
O,And you know what's ironic is that Mandy Moore and myself we start right at the beginning of our conversation we're talking about cats and it was two weeks ago and I was talking about and we're talking about dead dying cats .
O,I was talking about you know having to deal with the inevitability of my old cats going but I was like but I got this new guy .
O,He's only two and he'll be around for a while and then fuck and ironically he's still around but you know he's the one who got sick but he's OK he's OK .

I-AD,Is that a mile .
E-AD,Just hold it so OK .
O,This is something you need to know .
O,On a lighter note I .
O,OK .
O,I've been listening a bit Steely Dan and we've covered it all right .
O,You know some guy said I was going to be cursed and I'm not sure I'm not .
O,I'm not sure there wasn't a message in that .
O,Like as I told you then some you know like four years I was just like this Steely Dan annoying people like Steely Dan annoying .
O,You know just boring sterile soloists or whatever but then a couple of weeks ago as I talked about here on the podcast I I took turned a corner because I heard it in a different way .
O,But then I kind of got like then I was like I got to listen to all of it .
O,So I listened to all of it and I like it .
O,And the songs that I remember liking from you know just hearing them constantly you know they took a different life in my mind a little bit .
O,But like again I like it .
O,I get it .
O,I like it .
O,Not crazy about it .
O,But here's the fucking problem .
O,It's it's like OK how do I say this .
O,Steely Dan in my head I believe is starting to feed on the other music I enjoy in my head .
O,I think it's got a viral component to it .
O,I think it's it's it's parasitical .
O,Steely Dan in your head is like a parasite that eats the other music that you like because all of a sudden all the songs that are stuck in my head are Steely Dan songs .
O,And if I want to listen to I want listen to some stooges and that got Steely Dan song in my head .
O,It's not that I'm going to to listen to this Steely Dan but I think it's I think the music that I put in my head already is starting to feed on some of my other feelings about other music and I got to put a stop to that .
O,I have to get some anti Dan going .
O,I've got to .
O,There's got to be some sort of vaccination .
O,So now I've got to put together a Steely Dan disease vaccination song list in order to to sort of balance my brain and perhaps cleanse it from the viral nature of Steely Dan music .
O,So that said that was .
O,This is the price I'm paying for finally learning how to appreciate Steely Dan at this age .
O,Maybe if I was younger this tragedy would have happened but because I was older I dumped it all into my head at once .
O,Something bad is happening up there but I think I have the remedy for it .
O,I've plenty of music to start pushing back as an antiviral against the Steely Dan fucking ear worms that I've unleashed in my head .
O,Huh .
O,I'll be all right .
B-AD,We live in a world where we have so much access to data that gives us insight into who we are .
I-AD,But with more than one hundred twenty five genetic reports 23 and Me allows you to go beyond ancestry to access more personalized insights based on your DNA .
I-AD,You can even gain insights into your health traits and more with reports like the deep sweep report .
I-AD,If you've always suspected that you feel sweep year than others after missing a night of sweep your genes may be involved or the alcohol flush reaction report which details the genetic factors that make it hard for some people to process alcohol .
I-AD,There's also the saturated fat and weight report which can tell you about how your genetics may impact your body's response to your diet .
I-AD,Those things are all important but I was very happy to read my report which said that asparagus making my pee smell is actually a genetic trait .
I-AD,How many sleepless nights have you spent wondering about that .
I-AD,Now you know it's goes back generations see your great great great great grandfather probably after your experiments peed and said whoa see what your genes can say about your health your personality traits and more by your health and ancestry service kit .
I-AD,Today at 23 and Me dot com so I WTS .
E-AD,That's the number two three and me dot com slash WTS .
O,So Mandy Moore was lovely .
O,She was one of these people that came over and right away I'm like Oh I am in the presence of a star .
O,She's just got that charisma where you're kind of like I'm sitting across from a special person .
O,Yeah .
O,And she brought cookies .
O,So I don't know maybe they're connected but again we did start talking about cats and the irony is is that you know Buster was the guy I was like you know that guy is gonna be great .
O,And he he got sick but he's better he's better today .
O,Mandy of course is on the show .
O,This is us .
O,It airs Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern on NBC .
O,And this is me talking to her .
O,I don't think you asked though and I think Cuccinelli made it two years but we .
O,But we knew he had symptoms like he started walking like really close to the floor and like like fucked up really .
O,Yeah .
O,And so we brought it in got x ray and the guy told us that he had enlarged heart .
O,He said it wasn't gonna live long like you didn't .
O,Oh yeah see our vet .
O,We should be having some sort of health issues but it was related to like she didn't like an inflamed colon or something .
O,It was like a gastro .
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,And then we took her to like 50 different vets and she had series after series of tests .
O,Yeah .
O,And then the last vet we brought her to you know did an X-ray .
O,I said Do you know she has an enlarged heart .
O,It's nothing to worry about come back in a year and we'll check on it but this thing it's like it's catastrophic when it happens it's like someone having a heart attack .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,And it just like he just died she just .
O,Well we brought her into the vet but I mean I was sitting in the back with her holding her and I could just tell like there is how do you come back from that .
O,I was like she like I'm not sure she'll ever be able to walk again .
O,It was incredibly traumatic .
O,It's 11:00 the day before we got married .
O,Oh my God .
O,Sobbing all night for the cat for .
O,I mean you know it's there part of your family .
O,You know it's weird .
O,I've had the two I have are like 15 almost so I've had the longest relationships I've had with any living thing .
O,With them parents and they're they're healthy .
O,But I know at some point I mean they're 15 .
O,That little guy Buster he's like two and so you know two years he just showed up at the old house .
O,Sure .
O,I used to live in Highland Park .
O,Yeah .
O,Like I live by .
O,Like you're you're married to the dog guy .
O,Yeah .
O,What's his name .
O,Taylor .
O,Taylor .
O,Well that's nice .
O,Yeah .
O,Ron you know Boston the AMP guy .
O,Oh yes I know Austin .
O,Yes I've met him .
O,Austin who lived around the corner from me and he fixed this name for me it took it took me many many months for Austin to chase down the buses in the sand and I guess I met Austin through Blake like I'm not through Blake Miles right .
O,And I'm not a real you know musician guy .
O,I just happened to meet these guys .
O,Because they come on the show .
O,Yeah .
O,And Blake sort of a guy named Guy Mike that it's all high end from you know Justin then .
O,But I it's too bad you don't know Austin Well because I don't know if he remembers your husband's band uses those projector amps that Austin makes sure you probably know way more than I do .
O,It looks like a film projector .
O,OK sure .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,Because it's from an O .
O,Doesn't matter .
O,I saw it for some reason I have Austin's prototype projector up that he built with his dad .
O,I have it still because he told me to just hold on to it because he wanted me to try it years ago .
O,I mean he didn't he want me to hold onto it so he wouldn't sell it and I still have it .
O,You do .
O,I don't know if you remember it does well .
O,Maybe he'll listen to this and call you to it .
O,I never I don't use it .
O,Maybe he will .
O,So you're you're married to a rock guy and married to Rocky .
O,Yeah .
O,The second rocker secular rock .
O,I clearly I'm a glutton for punishment or I have a tape ha .
O,Yeah well I .
O,OK we don't have to start there .
O,I'm trying to ease into that .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,I want to I tried to get caught up on this is us but I just bounced around a lot .
O,Yeah .
O,And I it does something tells me it's not your type of show .
O,No but the thing is it could it is kind of really .
O,Yeah .
O,Because like I like to cry .
O,I don't necessarily want to to be public about it to .
O,Understand but I found that even jumping around that it seems like every five minutes in that show you can cry if necessary if you want to but it is you feel compelled .
O,It's designed like that .
O,I think termination .
O,It's designed to like yeah tap into the human condition and what makes us tick so yeah .
O,And at any given moment in a cry just now just now just hey now listen in Utah is they're just sort of right there for they are at all time are they .
O,Yeah for you too .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,I feel like the older I get for sure .
O,What is that .
O,Why are we .
O,Is it good .
O,I mean why not .
O,Just getting choked up all the time .
O,So what now .
O,You didn't grow up here .
O,I grew up in Florida .
O,Oh my God .
O,I know .
O,I'm sorry .
O,It's a weird place to grow up .
O,It's a weird place for anything .
O,Yeah .
O,So how did you get to Florida .
O,Do you start in Florida .
O,Yeah I was I was actually born in New Hampshire but both my parents are from Orlando .
O,No New Hampshire is nice .
O,New Hampshire is beautiful but I was there for six weeks .
O,That's Aaron's town .
O,They just ran away to have you .
O,They didn't want anyone to know anything about it .
O,It was too cold for them .
O,I really couldn't hack it .
O,So they moved there and they just left .
O,My dad is a pilot for American air health .
O,Mm hmm .
O,Really .
O,I bet you I've been on this plane .
O,I bet you have .
O,I'm very often more .
O,I don't remember that .
O,I'm very loyal to American Airlines .
O,So am I .
O,Yeah I have to be like he would have to be requisite .
O,We pray a little bit of a break I would imagine I might say I want to fly standby .
O,Who has time for that .
O,No no no no I'm not .
O,I'm Mandy Moore can't be standing there watching not people just know where you're going .
O,I understand but is a little .
O,Oh my God .
O,We flew standby and flew first class .
O,If he was available .
O,Yeah it was .
O,You got .
O,You guys are special .
O,Well what about special .
O,Well what if what if your dad's actually flying the plane .
O,I've never flown on a plane with my dad before .
O,He never did the cockpit thing .
O,How could you pass up .
O,He never offered .
O,Just when we were growing up he flew a lot to Lake south in Latin America and there was really no need for us to go and like any family vacations or any drug mule .
O,Back when you were a kid .
O,Not as a child .
O,No .
O,But now he flies mostly to London and Tokyo .
O,So why did he start in the air force now .
O,He was just a civilian pilot always .
O,Wow that's a I think that's a pretty .
O,There's something unique and special about that job there .
O,There you see there these weird kind of a they're national heroes that aren't identified with an ideology but there's something heroic about just being a commercial air pilot .
O,Were you like you know .
O,Yes sir .
O,But I will pass that on to him .
O,Yes .
O,So happy to hear that .
O,But it's not tied like you to I get .
O,They get that they have no affiliation .
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,So there's no reason to hate commercial air pilots or be judgmental of their cause .
O,Sure .
O,They're just trying to get people there safely .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,No .
O,Tom thanks .
O,I know I know .
O,Thanks for a service .
O,What was your mom do .
O,My mom was just Mom .
O,Yeah .
O,Do you have brothers and sisters .
O,I have an older and a younger brother .
O,How are they doing .
O,They're good .
O,Yeah they're out here .
O,Oh yeah .
O,You're trying their hand at the thing behind the scenes .
O,Oh yeah .
O,Like gapping or even being in production coordination .
O,Yeah well that's that's the grunts on the ground there .
O,Ron grunts I'm sorry .
O,I just wish a Vietnam episode so my .
O,Wait are you watching the the Ken Burns virally watch .
O,Oh you know this is us .
O,Yeah I was just in Vietnam earlier today .
O,Oh good gracious .
O,Yeah .
O,Sam used the word grunts and you know kind of this one an hour Terry thing .
O,I just I just declared your father a national hero for being a commercial pilot .
O,So tell me about surviving Florida .
O,Because look I know my mother's down there .
O,You know I have grown to appreciate Florida more but it's it's a freak show and I don't know about it that far down .
O,Like you don't need there or land .
O,I try to know as little as possible .
O,We wish .
O,She's in northern Florida .
O,No we don't .
O,So I don't know .
O,I know I don't know for it .
O,We're in the early central part of the state right .
O,No she's down by .
O,She's in Hollywood .
O,No she's not up in Tallahassee Hi Jewish Miami Jacksonville .
O,Just making do in Jackson she decided to retire to Jacksonville Florida .
O,Florida's odd I always tell people like any bizarre story .
O,Always had some Florida connection .
O,Yeah I mean I grew up in a very I grew up like 20 minutes north of Orlando .
O,So just a very boring normal .
O,And childhood is that by the time the park .
O,Yes .
O,Like it's even about 40 minutes north of that .
O,Wow .
O,Did you see the .
O,Did you see that movie the other Florida project .
O,Ted and I know everyone told me in the rough .
O,You can watch it now .
O,I have to I have to do that .
O,All right so you're just in for it .
O,You got an older and younger brother .
O,Yes .
O,They're out here doing what production work you say .
O,Yeah .
O,And you get along with them .
O,I do .
O,They're at the house occasionally .
O,Do they like doors .
O,They do like that .
O,Do you like doors more than they like Ryan and everyone .
O,Yeah .
O,Everyone in my life .
O,But how do you like what is that .
O,Because that era that you came up in in terms of you know in what you came up in the singing thing how does that start .
O,You know in Florida how do you become a pop sensation just pants .
O,Really .
O,Yeah .
O,I was like a a dorky theater kid .
O,I was in high school before .
O,No no it's like a kid like eight nine ten .
O,So you'd go you do plays and local community theater .
O,Oh yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,And I'm like no one in my family sings Xer is remotely artistic at all .
O,I don't know where it came from .
O,He just needed it .
O,I needed it .
O,I did .
O,I did like so much so that the Orlando Sentinel the local paper every Friday would have an audition hotline .
O,Yeah with all of the auditions coming up the next week and I would listen every Friday before school and see if there was anything for anyone my age like all across town really .
O,And my parents were so wonderful because they would schlep me here from audition to audition like you know far out outside of our little area .
O,Were there ever situations where you would go into an audition and your mom would be like I know about this place kind of an hour away maybe too far this doesn't seem like a real theater operation .
O,What was that guy .
O,No no .
O,We're not going here .
O,Well I did a ton of that until I in Orlando Magic came and saw a little girl my age sing the national anthem we talkin 12th and I had no idea that was even in the realm of possibility that that was a career today .
O,That was a career trajectory for a 12 year .
O,I can sing that whole center .
O,I begged my parents to try to put me on tape and send in like an audition to the magic and they did .
O,And I got chosen and from there I sang for the Magic Game .
O,And then I don't know I got sort of put into some sort of national anthem circuit where I then sang for every other sports team that played in that same arena .
O,I played for the I sang for the jackals which I think was the arena football team .
O,So you're the the anthem kid .
O,I was a little anthem kid .
O,I was singing .
O,I remember I was 13 .
O,I was singing at the ice hockey game and my dad was sitting in like the Goldie box or whatever the penalty box .
O,Yeah .
O,And I'm walking back after I sang I had my little pitch pipe and these two guys like bizarre men makin me over and my dad and me in Florida and Orlando and they asked me if I've ever recorded in a recording studio before two guys to ice and .
O,And they say We'd love to like we have some songs that we've written and we'd love to have you sing them to young guys like that .
O,Right right .
O,And my parents were like if you want to do that if you want to spend some of your own money that leave me like doing national commercials to do the commercials in the anthem gig .
O,Yeah .
O,You did some national commercials I did I did I did a Kmart commercial and a bunch of stuff for like the theme parks .
O,Nothing Superman nationals .
O,So you're making some money .
O,I mean no .
O,Well I love money but Kmart .
O,Yeah .
O,But enough to go sustain myself recording in some bizarre studio on the outskirts of Orlando .
O,Oh yeah .
O,So how is it so your parents .
O,I mean my parents are OK .
O,I'm in the studio recording what they drive me over there they sit in there with their lawyer with my mom and dad are there with the weird guys like the weird guys .
O,And it's looking back now .
O,It's so sketchy at the time .
O,It was like this is how they dealt with it and they kind is kind of I mean the record industry is not known for it's like you know deja ending .
O,Yeah .
O,So I'm in the studio and this guy who works for FedEx has a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend who's the head of Urban and are as they called it at Epic Records in New York .
O,That's big .
O,Yeah .
O,And there's this FedEx guy somehow maneuvers it up the chain and it gets to this .
O,This gentleman in New York just out of out of his goodness of his heart I mean clearly I'm sure there was he was looking to be a talent scout or you know get out find a new gig for himself did you give him a Christmas present .
O,They they definitely took care of him .
O,And this this guy flew down to Orlando from Epic Records and and our guy and our guy and I sang a song from a musical for him which musical Once Upon a Mattress I don't even I just knew this one song from the show and he belted it out belted it out for him I was 14 at the time and just started my freshman year of high school and he I don't know how but like heard something he liked and I signed with him and I left school just after Christmas break and as a freshman as a freshman and he went to New York I went to New York and started making my first record .
O,Yeah .
O,What's it called so real .
O,You were solely you .
O,I was .
O,It was teach stuff .
O,Shit hit 15 .
O,This was 1999 .
O,I mean come on now I know .
O,I don't know .
O,I see but it's sort of fascinating to me that you know you have this fund that you know this fundamental talent both as a actor and as a singer that's kind of you to put it that way .
O,I don't know if that was really the case .
O,No of course it was the case .
O,I mean you were running around doing this stuff and you know you you were charming enough to get these gigs you weren't they weren't laughing at you at the national anthem .
O,You were .
O,You were doing the job or you wouldn't have gotten the job .
O,I guess I guess you were in some free kid .
O,You know you're right .
O,You .
O,Sure .
O,But you know when you give people the benefit of the doubt when they're 12 13 years old and sing right for the benefit of the doubt is one thing but I'm a guy to fly down from New York and decide like nice kid .
O,Now that epic in our guy was he like old score or just another young 30 some .
O,He was a young guy .
O,He actually his big claim to fame was he had signed the Backstreet Boys when they were at Jive Records and he had just moved to epic .
O,And I think I was one of the first acts that he signed .
O,Now I unfortunately I was sort of I think a grown man kind of sure by the time all this happened .
O,So I was in your cup of tea .
O,No .
O,And I get I get him a lot of confused .
O,I miss the most things .
O,I miss him .
O,I I missed almost everything .
O,I don't know why but sure I did .
O,But but my question though is that .
O,So you go up to New York and you do a seeing now .
O,Were you just there .
O,Obviously someone had an idea of how you fit into the whole .
O,Yeah this was sort of I was on the cusp of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera like they had just come out and were just sort of like racing to the top .
O,We are fans of them to be quite honest didn't .
O,It was so new like you know my world .
O,I was my label's answer to those those girls but they they decided that they decided that I didn't know .
O,So it was hard to even like to be fans of them at that point because they were just sort of like coming and they were like kids too right .
O,They were kids to like 15 16 .
O,They were slightly older than like three or four years .
O,One of them weren't a Mouseketeer or something .
O,Both of them .
O,They both were yeah .
O,People assume that I was as well just because of the Orlando and other Mouseketeer kids here .
O,They found her at the park .
O,Down there Disney just churning them out yeah .
O,So you just like singing the songs you weren't writing the songs you were writing new songs for you but they they they wanted you to be this sort of cute sexualized you know temporary role between myself and and my contemporaries I guess is honestly I never had someone telling me that I needed to like no one made decisions for me .
O,No one tried to hyper sexualized my image and the music that I was singing .
O,I mean obviously at that point in time I probably like French kissed a boy band hadn't done anything else so I really didn't know everything that I was singing about but no one like no one made me dressed in a way that made me feel uncomfortable like I still felt very much in control of the image that I was acting the way I answer questions like right .
O,So if they suggested something you would be like OK yeah be in the sense that like you like did you choose your clothes .
O,But they presented it to you right right .
O,I mean there was like a stylist there with a rack of clothes in the same way that that's her here .
O,But yeah I still felt very much in control of making my own decisions .
O,And that first album had like one hit it did Candy Candy .
O,Yeah .
O,And then what happens when that happens so you're 15 now that people that are like you know going crazy for candy are little girls .
O,Yeah mostly little girls .
O,Okay so now you age right younger and they're all excited .
O,Mm hmm .
O,So they when they see you on the street they're excited and they're I don't know if I had that sort of recognition they have a video presence .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,I was still in the heyday of MTV and and very quickly .
O,Actually the record came out in 99 .
O,And that same year at the end of the year I signed a contract with MTV to become an MTV V-J .
O,So I was also on the channel as a V-J year helping TRL when Carson wasn't there and Carson Daly Carson Daly and there was a slightly different world .
O,He just never .
O,Like he never really changes much and he never goes away .
O,It's just sort of why you still out there doing it you're just you turn a TV on like that Carson do .
O,Yeah .
O,What time is it .
O,Two thirty in the morning .
O,He's got a show it to where now he's on with the Today show is on the Today show I know .
O,I finally landed in more in daytime .
O,Yeah I know but then I think he still has his own show .
O,Like you said at 2:00 in the morning as well but that show like I did it once and he wasn't even there .
O,I remember like they used to do these record these out of studio interviews it was a time where they'd sort of fold stuff in and it was his really late show wasn't the one where he was just doing a straight up talk show .
O,There were segments .
O,Yeah .
O,And I knew I was going to be on the Carson Daly Show .
O,Like someone interviewed me in a bar or something and then he just showed up there and I don't get to meet Carson there is only so much time in the day for him .
O,So yeah it's true .
O,So you're he's on MTV at that time .
O,Yes .
O,And who are the other cats on MTV to you and oh gosh Steve Holmes and I believe a Nona was another a tigress was .
O,It was a V-J at one point .
O,Oh yeah I mean it was .
O,Was he in baby boy .
O,Was s Dad's demo of that movie .
O,Yeah .
O,I haven't seen the movie .
O,Oh you gotta watch that movie huh .
O,It's great movie .
O,It's it's Singleton .
O,You know it's yeah Boyz in the hood .
O,Yeah .
O,I love that movie .
O,So do you guys you're all v J's .
O,Yeah there's like at that point there's like what 12 videos in rotation early this morning that probably more than that .
O,Yeah but it was back like during the heyday of MTV to where they had like MTV spring break MTV like snowed in Big Bear and like Jon Stewart is the host spring break and really he did .
O,That was before my time .
O,I was only spring break experience so by the way as a 15 and 16 year old with like drunk college guys leering at you .
O,Yeah .
O,No not a good thing .
O,That's a that's a part of America that never changes never drunk college guys leering at girl teenager teenage girls .
O,But but what .
O,But did you ever have to at that time were you just excited were you just happy to be part of it .
O,And absolutely .
O,And was there a competitive nature between you and not at all .
O,I mean first of all they had such tremendous success here comparatively .
O,I was I'm sure they didn't even know my name .
O,They probably didn't even know I existed .
O,So did you feel shitty .
O,No not at all .
O,I felt and I still feel like incredibly grateful to have had those opportunities and .
O,I mean here I am at 34 still having some semblance of a career thanks to that .
O,So no .
O,And I always knew like look I am not a performer like they are .
O,Did you stop aging at some point did you just stop .
O,I mean like you're here like I mean you're 30 for it but I feel like I've known about you my entire life and you're just I'm getting older and you're staying the same .
O,How does that happen .
O,I don't know .
O,No no .
O,I'm 34 certainly not the case .
O,I mean I've been doing this since I was 16 .
O,That's 15 .
O,So it's it's pretty mind blowing but but so were you an MTV personality when you do the second record .
O,Yes .
O,So it was all tied together like and you never felt any weirdness from the record like you .
O,It didn't get ugly .
O,No way .
O,In what way .
O,Well I mean it just feels like there would be a lot of pressure .
O,Like you know you're like this like I it's hard for me not to see younger people who get involved in the record business as products and being pushed a certain way .
O,I mean I suppose there was some of that going on but I didn't feel wholly aware .
O,You asked excited .
O,I was so excited for the opportunity .
O,And it was so overwhelming in a way that I just kept taking it day by day and not trying to look at the bigger picture of it all .
O,Yeah and I didn't know what I was doing right .
O,Oh there was no .
O,And you know being a young person you like to have all of that on my plate now would complete would give me anxiety .
O,It would freak me out right as a young person I was just like I go open up for the Backstreet Boys in front of like 20000 people and all these glow sticks and just the roar of the crowd and I wouldn't think anything of it .
O,Now I would have I would shit my pants leg you know I didn't do it .
O,You're just sort of locked in .
O,I was so lucky to go out and say yeah I had my backup dancers .
O,Yeah .
O,What I was doing but I just like I was in it .
O,Were you dancers in ish trying to really label noticed really early on .
O,Okay so she's not a dancer .
O,No I did one music video at the candy video where I'm like trying to dance horrendous .
O,And I think after that they realized they got her strong you should just sing it just like hold the microphone stand .
O,So that's why you're like you're not like .
O,Like I wasn't Britney or Christina .
O,They were they were real performers in every sense of the word .
O,So at the backstreet boys those are the Boston guys right .
O,That's New Kids on the block Oh damn it .
O,Where are they .
O,They were earlier .
O,They were an earlier incarnation of the boy band .
O,Yes .
O,So the Backstreet Boys Backstreet Boys N Sync they came after them then they aren't trying to come back or something extra .
O,It's still I think they're still at I guess doing a residency or something else doing it .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,Is that good or why not .
O,I guess so .
O,Right yeah .
O,I don't you wonder who goes are they .
O,Are they the teenage girls that were that all grown up now .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,And what they pray 40s .
O,But I feel like I have the same fan base in a way or at least like young women that were that sort of like grew up with me .
O,Well not like young moms and stuff for sure .
O,I guess there's sort of that nostalgia quotient too for for people with those kinds of bands who don't do you .
O,Well yeah .
O,I think for any band like I think that any band that made an impact on somebody when they were like 13 or 14 it's lodged in there .
O,Yeah .
O,And you kind of want to go back because it seems like as you get older there's some party that's always yearning to sort of like I wonder you know if I can you know tap back into that again touch with that person what happened to that for example .
O,But do you don't .
O,But you don't do no nostalgia shows do you .
O,No no no .
O,I haven't done music in a while .
O,I'm going back to it though .
O,All right .
O,Mm hmm .
O,Yeah .
O,We heard you did a little of that .
O,Where you got a band do you know any musician studio .
O,But you sang on the show .
O,I do I sing on the show .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,That's part of that's a back story of your life in the show too which was unknown to me when I auditioned .
O,I didn't know though .
O,I always wonder how much they know when they start writing these shows because I've been on a couple and the ones I'm on that I don't I don't get the sense that they know from season to season what the next season's going to look like but I something like this is also looks like they've got it mapped haven't you .
O,He absolutely has it mapped out until the end .
O,I think once I got the part here he decided to sort of add that into her backstory because we had worked together on that Disney movie Tangled and fog woman who created the hero Hansel and Rapunzel .
O,And so he knew that I sang because of that that film and that experience together so I think that may be factored in .
O,Yeah for the backstory here Yeah he knew that you were seeing .
O,You know I could carry a tune ish .
O,So OK so now you do the second record .
O,Yes .
O,Any hits .
O,Yeah .
O,There was there was a song called I Want To Be With You .
O,That was in sort of a teen dance romantic movie we had center stage I think for her .
O,And that was .
O,That was a moderate mediocre sort of hit .
O,It's a beautiful song .
O,Yeah .
O,And I loved it and I felt way more connected to the style and the fact that it felt like a little bit more organic and there was no need for me to even try to dance a song like that .
O,Right .
O,I really I enjoyed putting that record out .
O,It did have some snappy kind of Middle Eastern grooves .
O,Oh yeah yeah did it did .
O,It's not my choice .
O,That was a record label push .
O,I listen to some of the hits .
O,It doesn't really stand the test of time course .
O,Tyler what do you mean what's the test of time .
O,I mean you can still go now .
O,Yeah .
O,This is fun .
O,So to that one .
O,Yeah it's I mean it's still like you know you can dance to it and it's happy music .
O,I mean I don't think anyone you know look I don't I don't begrudge it .
O,I don't begrudge like the opportunities that it brought me but I can't say that I feel truly connected to any of that because I didn't have any real say creatively in the music like I was always allowed to be myself .
O,When it came to making those decisions .
O,But musically that's when you have the whole conglomerate of an entire machine of a record label behind you .
O,Right they know what's selling .
O,They know what the kids were like .
O,They know what their international markets are or they're trying to sort of do something that's a little off the beaten path and start a trend themselves and they're like Go down to Miami and work with Leo 7 .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,Okay yeah .
O,Here's what you do .
O,They're gonna be doing this .
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,And there's all kinds of drums behind .
O,Exactly .
O,Here's what the demo singer is doing .
O,Copy her right .
O,Yeah .
O,And you do it and you do it .
O,When did you get the first acting gig as a grunt or kind of right around that time when I was 16 .
O,I auditioned for the Garry Marshall movie The Princess Diaries .
O,That's a big movie with a big movie that was like the little girls again .
O,Yeah .
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,Well it was it was Anne Hathaway .
O,I love Julie Andrews Yeah .
O,She's amazing .
O,You know that I love her to you .
O,Yeah .
O,Do you love love her .
O,I kind of do .
O,She has an effect on people .
O,But then I get very impressive .
O,When I interviewed her and I kept it together .
O,Good go .
O,Thank you .
O,So do you and Anne Hathaway .
O,I'm sorry did Julie Andrews .
O,Yes that's right .
O,Yeah .
O,You get to work with Julianne .
O,She did .
O,But there was no singing in that movie was there now for me a little bit for me .
O,Was it fun working with Julie Andrews .
O,I mean I didn't really get to work with her but I was around her on set a couple times .
O,It's something I mean yes she is just my pop so .
O,But that was elevated your recognition factor I imagine .
O,Yes .
O,So it was like my first experience in a really professional setting dipping my toe into the acting .
O,Yeah .
O,And I realized that I really loved it .
O,And I sort of started putting myself out there and auditioning for other roles .
O,And then the next thing that came up was my next gig I guess was a walk to remember .
O,And that was sort of the the biggest one yeah to date and who is in that .
O,An actor by the name of Shane West .
O,A date .
O,That was your biggest movie .
O,And how did you meet in terms of sort of the the lead film .
O,Right .
O,Like besides this is us .
O,Yes .
O,The thing that people mentioned most to me in my day to day life and out there in the world home .
O,Well now I've got it .
O,I didn't have to watch .
O,No you don't .
O,I like Peter Coyote .
O,Peter Coyote played my father .
O,Yes .
O,It's a sort of weepy teen romance movie it's not does anyone die again .
O,Yeah .
O,A serious spoiler alert .
O,Yeah .
O,Do you .
O,I die you die at the end of the day .
O,You see now I'm sad .
O,My whole career is just based on making people cry .
O,I've realized it comes full circle .
O,That's heavy .
O,I'm good .
O,So that's like a love story for teenage it kind of was .
O,Yeah .
O,Would you die of leukemia .
O,There is a love story .
O,Oh yeah .
O,So that's what people remember because they like what people remember their world teenage brains .
O,Yeah they .
O,You introduce them to grief .
O,Yes .
O,Did it their first experience crying in a movie theater .
O,Was you with me like grown ladies come up to you like you know that movie still .
O,Yeah it's .
O,I mean I'm I'm so flattered to be a part of something that still has that sort of resonance with people .
O,Well it's never gonna .
O,Yeah .
O,So it's down in there but now .
O,But now it's like every week you have that resonates for you .
O,I guess I hope not .
O,You don't die .
O,No no .
O,Okay .
O,That would be my husband .
O,Yeah .
O,Well he's already dead right .
O,How did he die .
O,He dies of a heart attack from smoke inhalation .
O,Oh right .
O,Because he ran in to save the dog .
O,Yeah right .
O,I heard I got some I I was told got some insider information and my girlfriend's a secret fan of the show .
O,Really .
O,Yeah .
O,Then she like she .
O,I don't know why .
O,Like people there certain types of people they have for some reason don't want to cop to .
O,Yeah I understand .
O,I don't really .
O,I mean it's like why not .
O,You know I mean it's it's .
O,Everyone likes it because for a reason .
O,Yeah .
O,Doesn't mean it's bad it's not like a comedy it's like way .
O,I'm really proud of it .
O,You should be .
O,Like .
O,Didn't you get involved in some Twitter mistake I made with the big guy on the show .
O,Who .
O,Oh Chris Sullivan .
O,He like mistook him for someone who was like so excited that you maybe recognized him .
O,Well I felt bad because the other due to the guy who plays the Manny what's his name .
O,Justin .
O,Justin recognized me at the SAG Awards .
O,And like I because he watched the show I felt bad .
O,But you know he was gay OK all now I know like now I can have some navel point of reference .
O,I do .
O,Yeah .
O,And I feel better about it .
O,But yeah .
O,But that was the DeNiro thing where we were trying to act like we were just being casual and not waiting to finish this conversation .
O,It was ridiculous .
O,That's what you do at those shows though .
O,I mean it is your opportunity to go up and talk to people that your family has been an actor forever I've just been a guy that some people have gone to their people have come to my house and sat in my garage and now I'm all of a sudden an actor guy .
O,And it was really odd for me the first I'm nervous being here you are .
O,Yeah .
O,Why .
O,Cause I am because I listened to your show and I'm I'm .
O,I never thought that I would be in this scene .
O,So you isn't that right now .
O,I did .
O,I had .
O,I had to just to see if you can if he was gonna say something bad .
O,No no no I just was curious like what he was going to say when I get out of him I did all right for being .
O,You did .
O,Yeah .
O,It's hard to wrap your mind around .
O,I've actually not .
O,Usually you're the one that talks more than you know the person you're interviewing and that wasn't the case .
O,Excuse me .
O,It's your show .
O,I mean you're entitled I should take a leave .
O,I think that's always the case .
O,So you're saying you're right you're right .
O,It depends .
O,But I would say for the most part I taught when a job here than the guest .
O,Sometimes it's it's it said it said it's a dance dance it's like and it's also like sometimes you have to .
O,Yeah but no he just kept going .
O,Yeah but we're not there right now .
O,We're still we're not there yet .
O,Okay .
O,Well I think what I'm really curious about is that there is a point where you say like this is in me and I you know if I want to be a singer I have to find me .
O,Mm hmm .
O,Which album was that the label .
O,Let me make a covers record called coverage .
O,I was 18 .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,And I I got to choose whatever songs I wanted to cover .
O,Yeah I mean I chose Joni Mitchell I T C and Joe Jackson and I mean it it was I knew that we were sort of at the end of our our life together at the label .
O,Oh really really .
O,How do you know that .
O,I owed them one more record and I knew that it wasn't a relationship that was gonna continue because they weren't happy because I wasn't really selling records .
O,And the fact that they let me an 18 year old make a covers record of songs .
O,People my age had no idea about .
O,Kind of indicated like it was just sort of a last ditch effort to like you know allow me to sort of fulfill my obligation without and without the stakes being too high .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,And did it sell .
O,It didn't .
O,But people did .
O,I think I think people liked it and it served a purpose for me creatively .
O,Yeah .
O,I felt like it was a stepping stone in order for me to get to the place where I am now musically .
O,Yeah .
O,So you were able by choosing the songs you were able to that you loved you were able to inhabit them in your truth to itself .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,It's a good way of describing it .
O,Right .
O,And because they mean something to you .
O,They mean something to me and it was a way to honor music that I felt people my age were maybe missing out on .
O,Yeah but it like it brought me closer to wanting to be a songwriter myself and kind of take a grab hold of like I don't know the reins of my own career rightly but but also at this point thankfully on some level I mean I imagine it has to be kind of devastating that or at least to accept the fact that you know you're not selling and feel great but you're also acting .
O,But I didn't ever really sell like I never made any money from music I'd never really found any acclaim I never went on tour but a lot of people know who you are you think that's more from the movies .
O,But I think it's probably more from the acting side of things I'm not than musically .
O,I think the music sort of I was a supplement to what I was doing on the acting side .
O,It was a nice balance .
O,Yeah .
O,Music's always what I've been kind of more passionate about so I was happy to have some semblance of it in my life .
O,But I didn't lean on it too heavily thinking like this is my only source of income .
O,This is my source of creativity .
O,Yeah so .
O,So after coverage you leave what epic .
O,Yeah I left Sony .
O,I went to Warner Brothers for a second and then that didn't work out .
O,I started making a record with them and that didn't work out really .
O,And then I just went off and made my own record and like my management company at the time put it out and this was like 2004 .
O,That says in Wild Hope .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,How that do .
O,Okay .
O,I think I never really to be quite honest like I never kept track of stuff I can't find the last record you can't no Amanda Lee .
O,Yeah can find it .
O,Oh man .
O,Not an Apple music wise .
O,I don't know .
O,It's weird because I was thinking like that's the one .
O,It's cool .
O,It's by far my favorite .
O,Yeah .
O,Do you know Mike Viola .
O,Do I know and love his music .
O,Yeah he's a really good friend of mine an incredible musician .
O,You should .
O,He put out a record last year called The American Egypt .
O,That's will blow your mind .
O,I made my record with him .
O,This is like 2009 here and I felt like that was artistically again .
O,It was like I could do I could like we could do our Todd Rundgren song .
O,We could do our Joni song we do our McCartney song .
O,Yeah like we just had so many not covers just style no stylistically Yeah .
O,You're Todd Rundgren person here .
O,Not like a huge fan out there .
O,It's it's pretty hit or miss for me .
O,There's a lot there .
O,Yeah but it's interesting there's people that I talk to who I know who I respect by don't necessarily know the whole thing with musicians .
O,It's like you might like two records and then they've done 50 .
O,You like .
O,How many do I listen to that kind of describes my relationship with his music .
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,And something anything like .
O,But beyond that it's a little bit yeah .
O,In McCartney of course you gonna love McCartney .
O,How can you not say you in Vail I did a trip were you very conscious of the styles you were trying to sort of touch .
O,Very much .
O,I don't know why I couldn't find the record .
O,I think I'll I'll get you a copy .
O,Next you should talk to some people about that .
O,Yeah so but the movies keep happening .
O,Yes .
O,Yes .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,I mean I keep saying ash but they I would say like two thousand eight is sort of the year that things like 2008 2009 is when I sort of took maybe more of a conscious step back and like slowed down a little bit .
O,I got married in 2009 and that's when things really sort of quieted down for me quieted down career wise .
O,Yes .
O,Personally not so much but but professionally yes .
O,And that was a conscious decision because I had been going since I was 15 .
O,And what was what was that .
O,What was your reflection like .
O,I mean like because he had done well he hadn't done Rapunzel you hadn't done it and came like at the beginning of my marriage .
O,I started though in 2009 it didn't come out until 2010 .
O,Right .
O,So but like when you're sitting there saying you're you know you're taking a break or you're gonna reflect a little bit .
O,What was your feeling about who you were at that point .
O,I think it coincided with a period of growth where I didn't feel understood do it by the industry and maybe I didn't understand myself .
O,You felt like it kept coming up against a wall of like .
O,People see me in one regard .
O,Which was what one light .
O,I think the roles that I was getting offered or that people sort of tended to think of me for where you know that the girl next door which is lovely and is very much a facet of my personality but I was frustrated that that people were close minded and couldn't sort of see me as anything but that you wanted to challenge yourself .
O,Yeah .
O,What were you looking to do though .
O,The only thing anything left of center .
O,I mean like drug addict .
O,Sure .
O,All of it .
O,All of it .
O,Corporate leaders .
O,President I really thought so much in that direction .
O,I mean I was just open to write or whatever the world sort of was like oh that be an interesting turn for her .
O,And it wasn't really coming .
O,Well you must have pretty good representation .
O,They seem to keep you working .
O,You've worked .
O,No I I have .
O,Yeah it's been pretty steady but I asked my parents were getting divorced .
O,How old were you .
O,Twenty three .
O,I was really really dramatic and traumatic for me .
O,My mom left my father for a woman and it was completely surprising and it sort of coincided in a year where I had a lot .
O,I had this movie with Diane Keaton coming out had that record Wild Hope out I had another movie coming out and it was touring it was like maybe the busiest year to ever really had and it all sort of happened over the Christmas break right before the year started and she came out she .
O,I ended up finding a letter from her that she wasn't .
O,It was like a therapy exercise that she wasn't intending to send to us where at the house on her computer because I had bought her a laptop and I was setting up her laptop for her for Christmas right .
O,And I saw this letter in her like you know Draft folder here and I didn't know what to do .
O,And so I sort of confronted her after the holidays and told her that I had read it and it just it was really really dramatic .
O,But you were the only one who knew .
O,No I told my younger brother and .
O,And were you guys we were on vacation and it was where we were in I think North Carolina whole family the whole family were on Christmas vacation .
O,You had this information I had I found this information like sitting in the same room as my parents and you're a 23 .
O,Yeah .
O,And I didn't know what to do with it .
O,So I kind of like put the computer down basically the information wise I've been having an affair I've been having an affair and your father .
O,I'm in love with this woman and I feel so bad I have kind of talked about it before but and essentially like I'm I'm gonna be leaving your father and yeah I didn't .
O,I literally just sort of like glanced at it and sort of like words kind of jumped out at me but I didn't sit there like reading it and there was a whole entire shift so much to process an entire shift .
O,I ran upstairs my brother followed me because he could sense that something was wrong I told him what was going on and I was like we have to go down in and say something to them .
O,There are like literally across like sitting on the other couch watching TV in front of it and not just to her to them to them my parents my parents were both are not the not my mom's partner .
O,No no but I mean you were you were gonna you were gone the way your dad was going to find out .
O,No no I he knew he .
O,That's what it had indicated a letter that he that my dad knew and they were sort of trying to figure out the term what our relationship was going to look like and and so I was like ready to go to town and confront them and my brother you know thank goodness was like I don't think that's the right way to handle this .
O,My younger brother he's like You know dad seems like haven't you noticed that he's he's like he's really sort of like taking in this vacation I think he knows that this is perhaps the last time we're all going to be together as a family .
O,Well let let him have this time .
O,And so I had to go through like two or three more days of this vacation knowing this information and that's playing into intuitive so angry of at my mom .
O,Oh yeah yeah .
O,She was very intuitive of your brothers and she really was .
O,Yeah he's he's a sensitive thoughtful guy and it was the right move and we we like sat out the rest of the the family vacation and and then after the vacation is when I sort of confronted them confronted my mom .
O,How did that go .
O,Like I mean would you say .
O,I just said I I I found that letter on the laptop and she was shocked and didn't obviously want me to find out that way she was planning on sitting down and telling us in person and wanted to wait until like after the holidays .
O,But I I wasn't equipped emotionally to sort of like figure out how to compartmentalize it like I just did .
O,Exactly .
O,I just didn't know how to handle it other than to feel it wasn't that my mother was leaving my father for a woman it was that my mother was leaving my father .
O,They'd been together since high school they'd been married for 30 years .
O,Like I was one of the only people in my orbit that like whose parents were still together so I like a sense of pride about basher .
O,So that was what was so devastating that my mom had had this affair could have been with anybody .
O,All right .
O,So I spent a whole year kind of icing her out which was terrible but I didn't know what else to do and did did that relationship succeed .
O,Yes they're still together .
O,Wow .
O,Yeah .
O,So she knew she knew .
O,Yeah .
O,They've been together ever since .
O,And my dad .
O,Like six months later met my step mom and they're together and they're they've been together .
O,Yeah .
O,And as long do they talk to each other .
O,They do .
O,Yeah they were all at my wedding and I saw my I saw my step mom and my mom like on the dance floor together .
O,And really yeah .
O,My dad and my mom's partner dancing together .
O,So it's I don't think they talk often but it's not acrimonious they have three children together so and they're happier so much happier .
O,It's crazy how that happens in life .
O,Life .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,There with who they're meant to be with me .
O,They're like more fully realized .
O,More content .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,It's painful these transitions and people get it necessary .
O,Yeah it's hard to make those choices .
O,You know it is like how were you brought up religious wise you were somewhat Catholic but like Fairweather Catholic .
O,But were you would you say your fair parents were progressive because it was the fact that she was with the women sort of like white it was it was surprising but not no one was like judgmental about it and both of my brothers are gay as well .
O,Oh OK so it's .
O,And they could come out at that point before .
O,My mom had so it wasn't it wasn't shot .
O,It was shocking just in like on the surface right .
O,But you weren't in a conservative family .
O,No no no not at all .
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,And both your folks are Catholic .
O,No my dad never went to church with us .
O,It was always my mom's side .
O,She's Catholic .
O,She's had .
O,She was half Catholic half Jewish .
O,My grandmother was Catholic .
O,My grandfather was Jewish .
O,Did you know them .
O,I did .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,My my my mother's parents I knew my father's parents died when I was really little .
O,So you knew your Jewish grandfather did .
O,Was he like classic Jewish grandfather .
O,I mean he died when I was eight .
O,So I didn't get to know him like I mean I have vague memories of him but I mean I guess she was brought up Catholic .
O,She celebrated like Hanukkah and Christmas is how she always put it .
O,Haha yeah well this is all very exciting and then and then right around this time with the movies and everything else and you start the relationship with Ryan at that time like the next year .
O,Yeah we did .
O,Where did you find that the emotional upheaval of all that stuff .
O,Did did that play into you gravitating the largest factor of you know when you feel out of control in a situation .
O,I can't control my immediate family and the fact that like this particular situation sort of blew us up in a way .
O,Yeah so I left and broke a year you said .
O,I mean kind of definitely like never .
O,It's fractured us in a way that will never be the same obviously we won't .
O,We don't spend holidays all together anymore .
O,I think it's I guess that's sort of an inevitability anyway as you get older and you have your own family .
O,So I guess I kind of just thought well I'll just create my own family .
O,I'll start my own family .
O,Might my life seems out of control and this guy seems way out of control .
O,Then in retrospect I like I'm not here to act to throw no Ryan under the bus but just say yeah like I from everything I've heard about him he's notorious reputation precedes and it does it does .
O,But but but but that's interesting because the trauma of that experience at the age you were had is not completely you know like emotionally life threatening but it is trauma .
O,It is great .
O,Yeah and and it is sort of a kind of like you know like what what else didn't I know and like you know what was it all a lie kind of stuff .
O,Absolutely .
O,You re-evaluate your entire life and are young and yeah yeah .
O,This was like my way of steadying myself .
O,Did you .
O,But did you ever talk to your mother about why was this a surprise to her .
O,Yes .
O,Well of course .
O,I mean I talk to her like at the end of that year and it was a surprise to her it wasn't something she was looking for .
O,It was wasn't she likes to say that she is .
O,She's not into labels so she she just fell in love with this person and it could have been a woman or a man was that person do .
O,She is a tennis instructor .
O,They live in Sedona .
O,I live in Arizona .
O,Thank you from Florida to Arizona right now .
O,Red Rocks lots of red rocks and crystals and hiking like minded people .
O,Yep that was the one place in Arizona where there might be like the one little dot .
O,Exactly .
O,Well that's so .
O,So now .
O,Like you .
O,After that .
O,That's that's what brought on this sort of like I got it .
O,I've got to figure out where I'm at my life and you meet Ryan where we met on tour .
O,I was in Minneapolis and he was in Minneapolis .
O,I remember we were in city love Minneapolis .
O,I love it .
O,Love .
O,And we were driving in and one of the guys in my band was like hey Ryan Adams and the Cardinals is playing at that theater and I had no his music really sure but the band was really excited and when he's a band's band he's like a musician's musician .
O,Yeah .
O,So we were playing really early that day and we reached out to his people to see if we could go to the show .
O,You're playing really early like wife because of her kids .
O,No .
O,It was you know I think it was like an like an all ages while we're .
O,So I think like we were done by 8 o'clock or something .
O,So we managed to be able to go to his show and I remember we sat in the audience and and it was good but I was like the stage was really dark and they were .
O,I remember in like a semicircle and I didn't even know which one was Ryan but I was like wow it was great tight there .
O,Yeah .
O,And afterwards we got sort of ushered into this area where they said we were gonna meet the band music hall it's cool .
O,And at the time my friend Chris Stills his dad is Stephen Stills .
O,He was he was on tour and opening up for us and he's like Are you still friends with him .
O,I haven't seen Chris in for ever .
O,How's Dad doing .
O,I wonder his dad's doing .
O,I think his dad was losing his hearing .
O,No way .
O,So I heard .
O,Oh there's the Steve Stills one of the great voices .
O,Well Chris sounds exactly like his father .
O,He's got an incredible voice .
O,Is he still doing it .
O,He is .
O,Yeah .
O,He's still making music I get hip to .
O,Okay .
O,So .
O,So he he's like I know Ryan I worked with Ryan on one of his records or something .
O,Yeah and someone comes back to us who were standing there waiting for the rest of the band comes up and no Ryan .
O,Like he felt like he had really bad show and he doesn't want to meet anybody .
O,I was like Oh okay I'm a kid I'm like Okay fine that's my guy .
O,Tell us to go if we want to say hi to him we can go on the bus .
O,So we we Chris and I are like okay so we hop on the bus and Ryan's back there and he's on his laptop and he has these glasses on and crazy hair and like a flannel shirt and he shows us some ridiculous movie he's made on his laptop called like pizza ninja or something that he made with his bandmates Yeah digital camera .
O,Okay .
O,And I'm telling you I was just like this is this guy is the most bizarre person but his mind I am I've never met anyone like him .
O,Yeah .
O,And as a 23 year old impressionable young woman I told you I was really taken by him .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,I just like I I'd never met someone who had that lens on the world aha and blew your mind blew my mind and you know you just just .
O,He was so unabashedly like himself .
O,Yeah I guess .
O,Yeah .
O,And I left and I remember turning to Chris and I was like I really like .
O,He was like kind of a little guy kind of told me like you know what .
O,How old is he at that time .
O,Oh my gosh he's ten years older right .
O,He's like in his mid 30s .
O,Yeah yeah .
O,And maybe that was it was it and I was a fan of dating somehow .
O,Yeah .
O,And certainly there are a couple of months after that yeah we're out here eating he lived in New York .
O,So we sort of dated like I would go to New York and you were living out here then I was living out here .
O,Yeah I've been out here the whole time the whole time since .
O,What .
O,Ninety nine since their first record .
O,So you marry Ryan and as you look back on it in terms of your own creativity I mean I imagine musically it must have been a bit intimidating .
O,Yes yes and no .
O,I mean without getting too into the weeds .
O,He he is an incredibly like prolific writer .
O,Yeah .
O,Constantly writing constantly writing music and poetry .
O,And that's how he stays sane Yeah I I .
O,I guess I just think that I know him .
O,I think that's his .
O,That's just where he opted yes .
O,Right where he feels comfortable .
O,It's it's ingrained in the fiber of who he is if he's not creating he's not Ralph .
O,Right .
O,So it was intimidating but also it became the norm .
O,So after a while that kind of faded .
O,And you're like oh this is just my husband and he's writing another song .
O,Like yeah not that big of a deal .
O,And what were you doing .
O,I was living my life for him .
O,Yeah well co-dependency action .
O,Yeah .
O,Taking care of the taking of being the mother .
O,Oh yeah yeah .
O,And that that becomes .
O,That's an entirely unhealthy dynamic .
O,Well yeah .
O,Because you you lose yourself .
O,Oh I had no sense of self .
O,I was imperceptible .
O,I was so small in my own world .
O,Yeah .
O,It's interesting now .
O,Did you find that can you identify that dynamic in your parents or do you .
O,No it just it was a surprise .
O,The kind of enabling .
O,Trying to control the person thing or trying to take care of somebody who doesn't quite take care of themselves .
O,Yeah I think a little bit of all of that .
O,It made me feel worthy .
O,Yeah .
O,Made me feel like I had value if I could be there for somebody else and serve their needs .
O,You know because it I think it like not to go down again a rabbit hole with like therapy .
O,But I think it goes back to feeling undeserving of what I've had in my life .
O,You know as a person and finding success and right I think there was part of me that's like okay well this part of my life is I'm okay to not live for myself right now .
O,This guy needs I .
O,He needs me .
O,And I know how to do that .
O,I know this person who who's estranged from their family like I can show them what it's like to have a normal life .
O,And to celebrate birthdays and holidays and go on vacations and this is after your family is shattered after my .
O,Exactly and like let's do this together .
O,And I thought that that's how it was going to sort of unfold .
O,But you ended up a depleted husk of a person .
O,Essentially just devoid of self and to finance that running into things like co-dependency sort of bottom hitting .
O,You know sometimes people get clumsy they wreck cars you know cause you were no good .
O,I didn't do that .
O,Yeah I think it like it it my co-dependency fed into his co-dependency and some other issues underlying issues that like it was just the perfect cacophony of madness .
O,Yeah he really was I was so not serving myself .
O,And what was the moment where you're like uh I gotta get out .
O,I felt I felt like I was drowning .
O,No .
O,Yeah .
O,I just it was so untenable and unsustainable .
O,Yeah .
O,And I was so lonely .
O,I was so sad .
O,I was so far away all the time a year along with him .
O,I was lonely with him .
O,So were the worst .
O,There's nothing worse .
O,So I really kind of like a part of you detaches and they're just this talking thing and you're like it's talking again .
O,Why am I doing you're thinking about being other places and I just I knew that this wasn't the rest of my life and I knew that this was not the person I was supposed to be with .
O,I was not the person I was meant to be .
O,Was there a lot of drama like yelling and screaming and stuff .
O,Yeah .
O,And I am not a dramatic person .
O,I'm not a fighter .
O,Did you become one .
O,I would try to fight back but not .
O,I hate confrontation .
O,I shrink from it .
O,I avoided at all costs .
O,You're not good at it and you're living with it .
O,And I lived with it and I'm just like it's just not built in the fiber of who I am .
O,I'm not good at it .
O,I don't .
O,I can't find my words .
O,So you just did you were you like I'm done .
O,Kind of .
O,If it were only that easy .
O,But unfortunately it was not .
O,It just was a lot of of endless conversations prior conversations in a loop crying .
O,Yeah all of that for months and months and months and months and months even after filing for divorce .
O,Sorry you went through that .
O,Thank you .
O,OK .
O,It's all part of it .
O,And we did it .
O,How long were you with him .
O,Almost seven years .
O,So that's a long run .
O,So long run so that like you say you know for about three and a half it's great .
O,And then you have for about three it's just like ha ha .
O,And then for about a half it's like I might kill myself .
O,More or less .
O,Yeah yeah I've had I had two seven eight year ones now where you know where it's weird because you realize at some point the middle of those things where you're like I shouldn't be this shouldn't keep going .
O,No .
O,And then you've got not offend anybody .
O,Yeah and then it goes on for years more .
O,Yeah .
O,What do you do when you got out .
O,Six months later I got this is us all so that is so this is relatively fresh .
O,Yeah .
O,I mean it's three three four years right .
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,Three and a half years in spending .
O,It's crazy though like when you're not putting yourself when you're not prioritizing yourself yet and your needs in life .
O,Now I couldn't get traction with anything .
O,I was trying so desperately I was like all I want .
O,Before Ryan with Ryan was all I want is to be able to do a television show hopefully here in Los and have a nice job .
O,Have a nice gesture .
O,Yeah well I can just like I can come home every night .
O,I have my husband's here and we'll be on the road .
O,Yes I desperately wanted a family .
O,Why'd you dodge a bullet .
O,Yeah I think I think my I just innately knew like let's wait for things to settle down and find some even ground before I venture into that zero .
O,Think about that .
O,Oh yeah all the time .
O,I mean I'm just glad as everyone said like you're so lucky that you didn't have children because you're forever tied to that person .
O,And I don't want to be at all .
O,So now you're back .
O,Fresh slate .
O,So now it's a fresh slate .
O,So would you call that time though a career wise were you because you'd made this decision to sort of walk into something emotionally that you could at least out of control is the right word but rebuild for yourself right .
O,And you kind of prioritize that over everything I did and I didn't really have a choice .
O,I knew that I couldn't be in that relationship .
O,It wouldn't sustain itself if I was working as well because there would be glimmers of that of me .
O,I would do a little jobs .
O,It's not like I completely stopped working .
O,I would do things here or there but it became abundantly clear while I was working things would completely fall apart at home .
O,Really .
O,Yeah .
O,So it it showed me in what way .
O,It just you know if you're not there to take care of someone essentially who needs that who needs it then emotionally literally .
O,So you get estranged inside a week .
O,Yeah .
O,Like you come home and you're like What .
O,You know I just like endless .
O,I mean I hate to be so personal but it's like endless like I couldn't do my job because there was just a constant stream of of trying to pay attention to this person who needed me .
O,And who wouldn't let me do anything else because that's rough .
O,Yeah it was kind of you were kind of stifled completely salvage situation so it was like I knew that I wouldn't have even had my my best friend at the time was like you will not be able to work or find any semblance of success while you're in this marriage .
O,And I remember sort of like pooh poohing her at the time but also kind of wildly agreeing .
O,Yeah real .
O,And so I'm telling you those six months after I filed for divorce and the divorce was final .
O,I got the show .
O,Yeah yeah well I mean yeah I guess you were emotionally ready .
O,I was ready .
O,You had a lot of stuff .
O,I had a lot of baggage to bring to the table .
O,A lot of stuff in tears right underneath the multigenerational tears .
O,If you had enough emotional baggage that spanned three generations yes I feel like we do .
O,It's what you do .
O,Yeah well I mean that's a that I'm glad you .
O,It's one of those things where you know I have them too in my life where you have these relationships that if you really just think I just one or two things could have happened and .
O,That road would have been entirely different .
O,Yeah .
O,So and the show got hammered .
O,What was the audition process like for .
O,This is the age you really while you do a good job with it .
O,They'd say they do a great job right .
O,Well it's the interesting thing about you and like the small amount of research that I did was that it seems that you were able to you know stand out in a lot of the roles you did in movies that may not have been great things .
O,Yeah I mean like well it seems like you know for someone like Roger Ebert to consistently like you in things that he didn't like .
O,I mean that's a tough audience .
O,So what have I .
O,Yes .
O,But he did didn't he .
O,Yeah .
O,And so you have you know a unique thing as a as an actress and this is great that you can really kind of work the whole range of it .
O,Yeah .
O,But did you just .
O,Were they working for you or did you have to .
O,No I auditioned like I was a big process .
O,It was one of those pilots that was what they call off cycle .
O,So I remember it was like November .
O,And usually you know pilot season here in this town is like January and April all the time .
O,Well yeah with the different streaming platforms and stuff but like traditional network .
O,Right .
O,Pilot season is getting into air in February .
O,Yeah something like that .
O,Yeah it's like January to April .
O,I was I'm there so I auditioned in November and I was at the beginning of the audition process and they the feedback was like they really liked you but now they're gonna go to New York and Chicago and you know read a bunch of other girls .
O,So I didn't hear anything for about six weeks .
O,And then they came back and said you know we love to read you and a handful of other girls with a bunch of guys that we're considering and I'm just you know prepare your sides and Ryan did and I went in and the only guy I read with was Milo .
O,And I felt good about that because I heard going in like he's the guy to beat .
O,Right .
O,They love him .
O,Yeah everybody wants him to get the part .
O,Yeah so that's so harsh .
O,That's the worst .
O,That process of pleasing studio executives and reading in front of like a roomful of just judges faking like flop sweat .
O,I just think the worst the worst in testing .
O,Yeah .
O,That stuff the worst .
O,What is wrong and was horrible in the room who you are .
O,Yeah .
O,I just I feel like I'm like Just give me the part I can do it like just show up on the set and I'll show you but just believe just trust me .
O,OK .
O,What it's like being terrible at standardized tests but knowing that you have the capacity to like your work .
O,Sure .
O,Just auditions .
O,You know it's been so heavy to get it .
O,How long did it go on the audition .
O,Well the process it was like another month .
O,Yeah .
O,That's a lot .
O,Yeah .
O,Now did you like when you read the pay or were you like oh this is .
O,Yeah .
O,Oh yeah .
O,I did because I remember I had just signed with a new agent and we had talked a lot about like let's not do traditional pilot season because I had done it like a business is going in different direct totally but also I'd like done it three or four times .
O,I'd been disappointed in my pilots hadn't gotten picked up and I was so just like shattered .
O,And two weeks after that meeting I get this like script for an NBC pilot called The Untitled Dan Folkman project .
O,I was like What .
O,We just talked about like not doing network pilots .
O,Yeah .
O,And .
O,But I knew my I knew my my folks were you know on it .
O,And of course I read it and immediately it was like this is this is incredible writing and I love you .
O,And the concept it left the door wide open to go like in a different direction .
O,Yeah .
O,So I would either be a part of it and you are .
O,Yeah but it's and it's like .
O,It's a tremendous hit on a network show .
O,And that doesn't happen that much anymore .
O,Yeah .
O,Network gets it .
O,We're a dying breed kinda right .
O,No absolutely .
O,Yeah .
O,And it keeps winning all these prizes because it's so emotional .
O,People are acting that get out of the chain and perhaps solve and I'm sorry if I didn't I apologize if you did you did you did .
O,I mean I know who he is now because I watch the show .
O,It's very good and it's funny .
O,He is the best .
O,Yeah it's great .
O,And he was also in that thing on HBO right .
O,He was he was asked on the neck which I haven't seen but everybody raves about .
O,But OK .
O,So you never made a record .
O,You were on Ryan's record but you guys never did a record together .
O,Did didn't ever did any of his songs .
O,No .
O,But I would sing on his records .
O,It's weird that he never wrote the songs for you .
O,OK .
O,So .
O,No comment .
O,But you're you are going to return to music .
O,I am .
