B-AD,"Hi , it's Phoebe ."
I-AD,Just a quick note to let you know that we started another podcast .
I-AD,It's a very simple thing .
I-AD,"It's just me reading a classic mystery novel , a chapter a Day ."
I-AD,It's called Phoebe Reads a Mystery and you can get it wherever you're listening to this right now .
E-AD,"OK , here's the show ."
O,"We had a spate of freezing deaths in the month of January 2000 or the space of a couple of weeks , we would get these sort of sadly typical news releases from the city police that went along the lines of a 28 year old person found frozen ."
O,These were the general circumstances .
O,We aren't naming them because it's not a violent death and that's just how they handled it .
O,Danza Kreisky is a reporter for the CBC .
O,"In 2000 , he worked for the Star Phoenix newspaper in Saskatoon , Canada ."
O,So that particular month it was the post Christmas newsroom doldrums .
O,So I was assigned to take a look at one of these freezing deaths .
O,"There was a body found out by the city landfill , which is in sort of the southwest section of the city ."
O,It's a real relatively isolated for the city .
O,"And I was assigned to put together a sort of a best practices story on , you know , don't get drunk and try to walk home and develop a little bit of a feature on the individual who was frozen to try to put a human face on it ."
O,So I had begun to do my research .
O,"It it started off by , first of all , trying to find out the individual's name ."
O,"And it turned out to be a fellow named Lawrence Wagner , who was a social work student here in town and was reaching out to his family and trying to find his background while I was in the process of researching that my city editor hadn't gotten at the time what seemed like this absolutely improbable tip that city police had been dropping people off on the outside of town , First Nations people ."
O,Lawrence Wagner was the 30 year old First Nations member .
O,His body was found frozen to death on February 3rd .
O,"But as Danza Kreisky learned , he'd gone missing three days earlier ."
O,Dan wanted to know would last Lawrence Wagner .
O,"He started knocking on doors and one of the doors that I knocked upon was a woman named Alize , a white cap ."
O,"And I knocked on her doorway and I said , you know , had you heard anything about this ?"
O,The woman said that she did know Lawrence Wagner .
O,He was her nephew .
O,"And she goes , well , as a matter of fact , the night that he had gone missing , that evening , that freezing cold evening , he had knocked on my doorway and my daughter had answered it ."
O,"And he was clearly under the influence of some sort of intoxicant because he was basically in his shirt sleeves and jeans and he was yelling , pizza , pizza ."
O,So I had called the police .
O,I being Eliza .
O,"And when she called the police , they said the 9-1-1 operator told her that somebody else had already called about him and police had been dispatched ."
O,"So that was really the Sarah of terrible aha moment , because I had a clear connection involving the police and Mr. Wagner ."
O,He had come into contact with the police the night that he had died .
O,"Lawrence Wagner was found in a remote industrial area by a power plant , a place nobody walked , especially in the winter when Dan started looking into things ."
O,He noticed that another freezing death had been reported in the same area .
O,A First Nations man named Rodney Natus had been found there on January 29 .
O,"Two men's bodies , both frozen to death , found in the same place in the same week and then on February 4th ."
O,"A man came forward and said he'd been dropped off on the outskirts of town , but he had made it back alive ."
O,"I'm Phoebe , Judge ."
O,This is criminal .
O,Dear Knight was a First Nations man .
O,"He was 33 at the time , Danza Kreisky says the Saskatoon police knew Dara well ."
O,He was getting picked up frequently by them .
O,"Intoxicated , aggressive abuse of would be put in a cruiser , would be taken downtown , spend the night in the drunk tank , released the next day , and then it was sort of shampoo , rinse , repeat ."
O,"In the early hours of January 28 , Darrell Knight had been at his uncle's apartment ."
O,They'd fought in around dawn .
O,"Two police officers found Darrell Knight outside the apartment , intoxicated and yelling ."
O,Darrell Knight later said the officers handcuffed him and put him in the back seat .
O,"His account was put into the back of this cruiser , and he knows almost immediately that he's not being driven to the police station because it's the opposite direction ."
O,And I recall speaking to him and he said the car got real quiet .
O,"You know , he he realized something was up ."
O,I think he was concerned that I was just gonna lead to a beating .
O,Was he going to be shot ?
O,He didn't know what was going on .
O,"You know , you're in this cruiser and you think the cruiser should be going north and it's going south ."
O,And instead of heading towards the bright lights .
O,So you're heading out into the darkness and you've got these two police officers in the front seat who aren't talking to you .
O,They're just drive .
O,And you it was a terrifying experience for him .
O,"Daryl Knight , leader said that the police drove him to a remote area and told him to get out of the car ."
O,He told the police he thought he would freeze to death .
O,"And according to Darrell Knight , one of the officers said that's your problem ."
O,And the police car drove away .
O,"He later said , I thought I was dead ."
O,"All those rumors I heard in the past , they were all coming true ."
O,"When we first started reporting on this phenomena of what was happening , I can remember a First Nations guy telling me , oh , it's just a Starlight Tours ."
O,"And we'd heard , you know , versions of this in the past ."
O,"You know , the idea being that police would pick a person up who was intoxicated ."
O,They don't want to take him into the station because it involves a lot of paperwork .
O,This fellow's thrown in jail .
O,"So they'll think , oh , look , instead of taking you into the police station and charging you , we'll just take you somewhere and you can walk it off ."
O,So was kind of an open secret .
O,"What's problematic is if you're dealing with somebody who's really intoxicated and it's 30 below and you take them somewhere , they might not make it back ."
O,"So the scenario that was presented to us , the tip was that police had , in fact , done this , taken a person to the edge of town in really cold weather and dropped them off and they never made it back in ."
O,"When we're talking really cold weather in Saskatoon in January , what temperature are we talking ?"
O,It would be .
O,"I guess , you know , simply for comparison purposes , 40 below , which is , you know , 40 below Celsius and 40 below Fahrenheit are the same ."
O,"So 40 below freezing cold , you can die ."
O,"You know , if it's windy out , you'll get frostbite on your face in a matter of minutes ."
O,So this is full on Paka Park of weather .
O,"Yeah , it's the type of weather where if you're not careful , you can die whether you're intoxicated or not ."
O,"So at this point , the police ."
O,"Was it the idea that the police , most of the police departments just finding out that ."
O,Wait a second .
O,There are some officers who've been doing this .
O,Or was it .
O,"Oh , now we've always known this and now everyone else knows it , too ."
O,"I think within the service back in around 2000 , it was I think I would characterize it as a mature police service ."
O,"You know , in the sense that the the average age of the officers and the years of experience was a little bit older ."
O,"You know , they rather they did their business the way they did their business ."
O,They weren't under a lot of scrutiny .
O,"So just within the police service , they were trying to figure out , well , who was working that night , who was in that particular sector of the city , is it conceivable that they would have dropped them off ?"
O,How widespread is this ?
O,"On February 7th , two constables for the Saskatoon police force , Dan Hanson and Ken Munson , admitted that they'd picked up Darryl Knight , driven him to a remote area and left him there ."
O,"Three days later , they were suspended with pay ."
O,And then the Saskatoon police chief announced he was ordering a homicide investigation into the deaths of Rodney nieces and Lawrence Wegner .
O,And another investigation into the claims made by Daryl Knight .
O,The Saskatchewan Justice Department called in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to take over the investigations .
O,A Kreisky remembers feeling like the whole thing was starting to explode .
O,"I can remember driving home in my car and seeing police cars and being nervous thinking , are they following me because I'm doing this story ?"
O,"However , we uncovered this this horrible practice that's been going on ."
O,It was an awful experience .
O,And and trying to think how far back did it go ?
O,"I mean , even something as simple as a simples , maybe the wrong word ."
O,"But when I was doing the research on Lawrence Wagner , you know , trying to do the death by misadventure story , going back in our files and finding out about Rodney Nestor's , which had happened right at the same time , and I had just never connected the dots because it just seemed like another freezing death ."
O,"And then all of a sudden you have to First Nations guys found frozen right in the same area of town , right on the same weekend with Daryl Knight ."
O,It was terrifying .
O,It just seemed like we went from nothing to anything was possible .
O,Is there any thought about how many people were taken on these Starlight tours ?
O,"My gosh , once we broke the story , the phone lines just lit up from people in the First Nations community calling not just within Saskatoon from around the province , saying , oh , yeah ."
O,This happens all the time .
O,"But nobody ever believed us when we told people , you know , were socially and economically disadvantaged First Nations people being taken out by the state , by the representatives of the state , you know , who's going to believe us ?"
O,White reporters aren't going to believe us .
O,That was just sort of their world .
O,Dan's across key remembers that one day his colleague Less Perot was going back through the newspaper's archives looking for mentions of freezing deaths or First Nations men found in remote areas .
O,I remember vividly sitting at my desk in the Star Phoenix newsroom .
O,"And lo and behold , he got back to 1991 and I'm sitting there and he just sort of makes this noise of great surprise ."
O,"And I turn and look at him and he goes , meet Neil Storen , child , and he turns around and holds up our scrapbook ."
O,"And there was the page one story on , you know , family concerned with teens , suspicious death ."
O,"And it was all there , all the elements of the concerned families ."
O,The disturbing set of facts were all there .
O,Basically a decade earlier .
O,"While the Saskatoon Police Service was under scrutiny , there was one man inside the police service who is doing a sort of investigation of his own and beat in northern Ontario , kid very respectful of the cold and its power , its very powerful things in it ."
O,Then it just bugged me like how did this kid end up there ?
O,"And I thought , well , when I get back to work , I'll find out what's going on ."
O,This is our only looted at the time .
O,He was a constable for the Saskatoon Police Service .
O,"When you started with the Saskatoon Police Force , how many First Nations officers were there ?"
O,There was 2 ahead of me .
O,I was the third one .
O,So in and out .
O,What percent would you say that was of the full force of 1 percent ?
O,"Here's what , 350 officers ."
O,I think when I started at and it was the same pretty much across the board .
O,I think maybe 10 or 15 women at the time assisting police and I got hired .
O,"There was one Asian Canadian , there was one African Canadian ."
O,"And there was more to it for us that the guys were like guys , large farmers , lots of farmers , kids , lots of key players ."
O,And I chose to work in two places in Saskatoon that were the first nation population was really high and it just became an identifiable person .
O,"You didn't have to like me if you did , but you knew who I was and that made such a difference ."
O,So I end up pretty much sticking up patrol for my entire career .
O,"Ernie , it was familiar with 17 year old Neil Stone child and his 14 year old brother Jake ."
O,They were both Sarto First Nations members .
O,"The Stone Child Brothers had had multiple run-ins with the police for petty theft , drinking and breaking probation ."
O,Both boys had spent time in youth detention centers .
O,Erni found it very odd that Neil Stone child would be found by himself in such a remote area wearing only one shoe when the temperatures were so far below freezing .
O,The local paper reported that his blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit and his cause of death was listed as hypothermia .
O,He was last seen five days before his body was found .
O,"Ernie wanted to see what was in the Saskatoon police file , which he wasn't supposed to be looking at because he wasn't a detective ."
O,He looked it up anyway .
O,"It went back to the police station and found the file number on the computer and against regulations , had the girls pull the file ."
O,So had no no involvement in it .
O,"That girl from Central Records , a lady said records ."
O,And they pulled it for me .
O,"And because it wasn't my file , anyone , we caught reading a detective's file , especially on a sudden death , because , you know , sudden deaths in homicides were suppose to be really not not perused by patrolman ."
O,"As a case , you learned something you didn't weren't supposed to learn or whatever ."
O,Ernie made a photocopy of the file and took it home with him .
O,And I read this report .
O,It was right .
O,"Twenty six years , I can remember ."
O,How many pages ?
O,Twenty seven .
O,Wasn't Fosbury Long .
O,Most of it's just your initial responding officers and also forgotten to get to the investigation of it .
O,And it was concluded it the investigator concluded that Neil St. Charles had wandered .
O,It was going up to Adult Correctional Center to turn himself in on smolts any words yet ?
O,And I knew right off the bat that I was .
O,That was ludicrous .
O,"It was for one , he was a young offender and candidate , young offenders , 18 and under ."
O,And there they don't get housed at adult institutions .
O,So basically said that he was walking to the wrong facility to turn himself in .
O,Any froze to death .
O,"Basically , that was the conclusion ."
O,"Ernie went to see Neil's mother , Stella Begnaud ."
O,The last time Stella had seen Neil was the night of November 24th .
O,"Five days later , the police showed up at her door and told her his body had been found ."
O,She told Ernie that she couldn't get any updates from the police and that she couldn't get anyone to give her back her son's belongings .
O,She felt like no one was listening to her .
O,Erni says he made up his mind that he was going to try to help .
O,"First , he went to a staff sergeant ."
O,He says that didn't go well .
O,He was told to speak with Sergeant Keith Jarvis .
O,Sergeant Jarvis had been with the Saskatoon Police Service for 24 years and he'd been in charge of the investigation into Neil Stone child's death .
O,He closed the file and I went into certain services office and it went bad .
O,"From the minute I walked through the door , you could tell ."
O,I was .
O,I was the last person he wanted to see .
O,What did you say when you walked in ?
O,I say I have information about the definite deals .
O,Don't show up .
O,And he was instantly angry .
O,"He you know , he says , what are you doing medaling this kind of thing ?"
O,"And it went on for 45 minutes and basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about , that I shouldn't be meddling in things ."
O,I don't know anything about nothing .
O,I can remember about that meeting was even remotely good .
O,There is no thanks for bringing this information in .
O,"You know , we look into it , blah , blah , blah ."
O,Nothing .
O,"Just 45 minutes later , if he knew what my concerns were , he pretty much told me that that's keep my nose out of it the day that things get out to me ."
O,"And that's such an open statement , right ?"
O,That things can happen to you .
O,"And when your copy of it could be a lot of things , it could be you could be sidelined into a front desk position ."
O,"You could be you know , I'm not ."
O,Right .
O,"Anyway , it was ."
O,So I left there and I was I was incredibly frustrated .
O,"I thought , well , you know , there's no way they could not do something now ."
O,I'd given them all the information I had .
O,"You know , whether it was hearsay or not , it was still worthy of of them having a look at it ."
O,And there's I thought they'd got it .
O,They're going to contact Stella .
O,"And at least reopen us or take a second harder look , at least a supervisor ."
O,"But I went back and seen Stella my next shift , and she said no one had been this year at all and that nothing had changed ."
O,"And I said to her , I said , if there was a white kid , I said , are the son of the Mary said , I'm sure this wouldn't be closed ."
O,And you know that you be treated better .
O,Knows .
O,It was just it was such to me .
O,"It was such poor , poor policing ."
O,"A few months after Neil Stone Child's body was found , the Star Phoenix ran a story with the headline Family Suspects Foul Play ."
O,Police say every avenue investigated .
O,That was the article that Dan and his colleague Less Perreault found a decade later when they were digging through the paper's archives .
O,They decided to put Neil Stone Child back in the newspaper on the front page .
O,"Nearly 10 years after his death , they put his picture and his story just above a story about the suspected role of Saskatoon police officers in the deaths of Rodney Maestas and Lawrence Wegner ."
O,"Inquests were just getting underway into those cases and juries would end up concluding that the men died of hypothermia but failed , quote , to determine the circumstances leading to the deaths ."
O,"In the case of Darryl Knight , the man who had survived being dropped off by police , an all white jury ."
O,Seven men and five women found constables Dan Hagin and Ken Munson guilty of unlawful confinement .
O,They were sentenced to eight months in a low security correctional facility .
O,"With all this going on , there was a lot of renewed interest in the circumstances surrounding Neil Stone child's death ."
O,Federal police started looking into it .
O,But there is a problem .
O,"No one could find the police report from the initial investigation in 1990 , the file had been purged ."
O,That was it was a rumor at first .
O,And I didn't pay attention to it because we were just there were so many rumors going around .
O,It's time .
O,So I'd heard that the file had been purged in a routine purge of files .
O,10 years or older and assisting placers when they were trying to free up space in our old police station .
O,So I got interviewed in a whole bunch tie-ins because I .
O,But then they'd learned that I'd had information about it .
O,"So I had my notes , all the notes they had , and I showed it to them ."
O,Sure .
O,Until I got interviewed by the RCMP several times and all during this while this was going on .
O,"Course , you police became the kind of focus of the national attention in Canada and corser as accusations of racism and murder and all these things ."
O,The RCMP is the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
O,Canada's federal law enforcement .
O,Erni says he was willing to talk to them .
O,The case had been bothering him for years .
O,"He remembered his conversations with Neil Stone , child's mother and brother , and remembered thinking that something didn't seem right ."
O,"And then one day in 2001 , Ernie was looking for something in his basement ."
O,Going through old boxes .
O,When he opened a box that he hadn't opened in 10 years and then was sitting there with a copy of the Neil Stone Child record .
O,You'd forgotten that you saved it ?
O,"Yeah , I had my possible explosives call our ticket box for so long and I took it out and just brought it home and I put it in my berry box and it was the only important existence ."
O,"And I called the RCMP guy right away and I called our deputy chief from the SUSSINGHAM police service and got a gun in my truck , drove downtown , gave it to them and they photocopied it ."
O,What were you thinking ?
O,Were you thinking ?
O,"No , thank God I saved this ."
O,Are you thinking I'm going to get an even more trouble now or .
O,"You know , I thought I thought I was gonna be in trouble , actually , because , you know , you weren't supposed take reports for this one ."
O,"Always bugged me , Soileau ."
O,"Always , captain ."
O,Yeah .
O,"I you know , I kind of felt jeopardy ."
O,"There's a few times through this whole course , all this I felt Jeopardy disc just for breaking rules or whatever the case was ."
O,"But this one here , I knew when I filed the report that that was gonna change things for for me , I was gonna change things for a lot of people ."
O,But I was happy in one respect that I was trying to articulate what my concerns were to the RCMP and stuff like that .
O,And there it wasn't black and white reporter Danza Kreisky .
O,Ernie was able to produce original documentary evidence that just sold how badly the police service had screwed up that investigation .
O,He played an incredible part and he had an insight into how it wasn't handled .
O,In February 2003 .
O,Saskatchewan's justice minister announced there'd be an official inquiry into the death of Neil Stone Child .
O,The inquiry started in September .
O,There'd be 43 days of testimony and 63 people would testify .
O,So a lot of work in the inquiry went into trying to establish or come up with a set of facts on what happened the evening that Neil Stone child went missing .
O,"And again , this was happening at a time in the police service when we know we didn't have in-car cameras , we didn't have G.P.S. units in the cars ."
O,"So it was difficult to have kind of an objective standard of , you know , who was where and when , according to the original investigative report , the one that Ernie had photocopied and had been filed by Sergeant Jarvis back in 1990 ."
O,No member of the police force had any contact with Neil Stone child on the night of his death .
O,"But during the inquiry , Neil's friend Jason Roye testified that he'd seen Neil in a police car that night ."
O,"Jason said Neil had been yelling , Help me ."
O,These guys are going to kill me .
O,Jason Royte testified .
O,"He told Sergeant Jarvis about seeing Neil in a police car , but none of this made it into the report ."
O,Several of Neil's family members testified that they'd seen gashes and bruises on Neil's face at the funeral and marks on his wrists .
O,Ernie Looted testified for two days .
O,What did you say when you testified ?
O,I was so I go sugar-coated .
O,"I was I soundly criticized assisting police in their investigative procedures and how , you know , how Neil Stone charged that in particular was investigated ."
O,I talked about the environment back then and and the way his death was investigated was .
O,"It's awful , and the way his family is treated was awful ."
O,"Did anyone say , you know , your turn coat ?"
O,Or do you don't do that to .
O,I'd say .
O,"Most everybody that I worked with , like my generation offshoots , were supportive ."
O,All right .
O,Some of the older cops were not .
O,But I don't want to paint all those guys with the same brush .
O,There is a lot of good police officers back .
O,"And just I partly , I suppose , because where I was working , I I dealt with more those the ones that weren't ."
O,"But yeah , lost lost friends , made friends , even , you know , I think that self-preservation thing kicked in ."
O,A lot of police just didn't want to talk away .
O,Right .
O,And and even years later .
O,"For me now , there's still police officers retired that say he should quit talking about this Neil Stone child thing ."
O,Right .
O,"And for a while , you know , I think ."
O,What are they right ?
O,Should I stop talking ?
O,And then I thought about it .
O,"No , it was an important story ."
O,"And at the end of the inquiry , you kind of skip into ahead here ."
O,But at the end of the inquiry .
O,"The justice right , who had overseen the inquiry , released his report was five months after the inquiry ended and my wife and I were sitting at home and the provincial minister was releasing it ."
O,And just as right .
O,Stated that he believed that to sustain police constables had Neil Stone child in their cars the other night that he died .
O,And it was shocking .
O,Here stands the Kreisky .
O,They lost their jobs .
O,"There was never enough evidence to the to criminal charges , but they were tagged as the guys who had , for lack of a better expression , killed Neil Stone child ."
O,And not everybody believed it .
O,"You know that the police association , that the chronology that was put together was a tough set of facts all around ."
O,"But these fellows , you know , we look back on it ."
O,They paid for the sins of the Saskatoon Police Service in Neil Stone Child's Death .
O,"I think the really damning part of the Stone Child inquiry , though , was when the family came forward , how the investigation was just blown off ."
O,There was no investigation .
O,And that became a real systemic issue .
O,Justice Wright called Sergeant Jarvis's investigation superficial and totally inadequate .
O,He made a series of recommendations to the Saskatoon Police Service .
O,"They included in-depth training about race and that the province , quote , establish an introductory program for Aboriginal candidates and candidates from minority communities for police services ."
O,Do you think that the deaths would have been investigated earlier if it hadn't been First Nations people ?
O,"I don't know , it's it doesn't ."
O,"You know , probably , yeah ."
O,I'm hesitating because it doesn't speak well for media as well .
O,"Certainly within the First Nations community , there was a sense that , oh , you're just waking up to this now was an eye opener for a lot of people , myself included ."
O,I think this to be the first time that most people in the United States will have heard about this in June of 2003 .
O,Then Police Chief Russell Sabot apologized on behalf of the Saskatoon police force .
O,"He also said , quote , It's quite conceivable there were other times he said that in 1976 , an officer was disciplined for driving a native woman to the outskirts of town and abandoning her there ."
O,"In 2016 , Danza Kreisky was contacted by a college student trying to write a paper on the Saskatoon Police Service ."
O,The student told Dan he couldn't find anything about the Starlight tours on the Saskatoon Police Service's Wikipedia page .
O,"And when he checked back , he found out that it had actually been edited out ."
O,"Apparently , that's one of the features of Wikipedia , as you can see the edits ."
O,"And he did some digging and we verify this , that the Starlight Tours section had been edited out by somebody at the police station ."
O,"Now , what we were able to determine was that the police were sort of caught dead to rights ."
O,"You know , they acknowledged that , yes , the IP addresses as to where these edits were done trace us back to the station ."
O,But they were never able to determine who or where in the station happened .
O,Their Internet logs were wiped every 30 days just because of the amount of traffic .
O,"So they admitted that somebody in the station , for whatever reason , had decided to take that particular part of their history out ."
O,"And it was very embarrassing for them because , you know , you're 16 years past the inquiry and all that stuff ."
O,And yet there was clearly still people within the station who just didn't want that to be known .
O,"We contacted the Saskatoon Police Service for this story and received the following statement from the current police chief , Troy Cooper ."
O,All recommendations made as part of the inquiry into Neil Stone child's death were implemented by the Saskatoon Police Service .
O,"There's been a great deal of change within the service over the last 16 years , including training , recruiting and relationship building with members of the indigenous community ."
O,We continue to look for ways to strengthen those relationships .
O,The majority of our officers currently serving were hired after the 2004 inquiry and after the changes were implemented .
O,Our service supports calls for an independent oversight board .
