O,A decade ago a company joined tech SaaS incubator in Boulder Colorado and that company was sent grid and they went public .
O,The first incubator company to ever go public came out of tech start as you might think Y Combinator or Five Sharps .
O,Nope came out of TechStars and that company was recently acquired by Twilio another amazing company .
O,And to talk about the amazing growth that San greatest had and this journey from growth all the way to acquisition is similar to L'Aquila .
O,Hey did I get it right .
O,I got it perfect perfect SLAM DUNK IT DON'T at Samir De Luca who is the CEO and you you joined what you're four or five at the company
O,that's right yeah . Five years
O,and five years in now and this is sometimes like a controversial topic .
O,Yeah
O,bringing in a professional CEO .
O,How did that all go down was it out of some weakness the company was not being managed properly or opportunistic they wanted to deal with the scaling and they did a proper search etc. .
O,How did you come about that you got drawn into this .
O,Yeah I think I I was the second actually professional CEO brought in Iowa so I . So the founding story three developers awesome amazing guys .
O,Isaac Tim and a kick this thing off in 0 9 as you said through TechStars
O,and they just had this insight that every time you build an application when you click on the forgot password button it has to be there has to be code that sits behind it that sends you an automated e-mail that allows you to go and reset it or if you click the buy button . Same thing
O,like an automated e-mail comes in .
O,No human .
O,And setting up the code to do that was crazy complicated and like there shouldn't be that complicated
O,every application on the planet every Web site on the planet has to do this .
O,Let's make something easy .
O,Put in the cloud and off they go .
O,So they literally come out of the TechStars .
O,They graduate from TechStars at the end of the program and everyone in the program is using it and it's immediate like they go Yeah .
O,The acceleration in the business was immediate
O,about two years in maybe not even that about 18 two months two years and they they got their series A and then we're asked you know Hey gents you know we'd love to bring in a professional CEO .
O,They can continue to help scale this thing because it's clearly going to be a rocket ship
O,right .
O,So that's where my predecessor came in .
O,A guy named Jim Franklin great guys did amazing work for the business for which we're all very grateful and and then I joined I .
O,But he only lasted two years so it could have been that great .
O,No actually I if I look back I think he was there for a good three and a half almost three and half four years .
O,All right .
O,So yes he did and he did a great job he took it from two million in revenue probably to about 30 .
O,Oh that would be pretty good .
O,Yeah .
O,And he did a great job over that period time .
O,The thing that I said double double double .
O,Right .
O,Two to four to eight it's probably better than that .
O,I think it was more like .
O,I think they tripled .
O,I think it was Triple Triple double double .
O,I think in those three years was a great credit .
O,Absolutely and I'm really great .
O,The thing I'm most grateful to Jim for is the culture that he embedded in the company at that early stage and we care a ton about culture and people and values and how we do our work matters as much shows as what we're doing .
O,And I think he did a tremendous job he brought this this notion of what we call the four H's happy hungry humble and honest .
O,It's very simple easy to remember .
O,You know that's those that became the culture that became like your values I guess .
O,That's right .
O,Did you . Before you came there did you think values was like a soft kind of you know wishy washy feel good hippy dippy whatever kind of thing . Did you actually believe in culture back then 10 years ago .
O,You know even then I would say I would say 10 or 15 years ago I was probably more on the OK you know . That's all fine and good . If you don't have a great business you're in trouble which I still think is true .
O,But by the time I got to that stage of my career when I was looking for my next thing on my criteria list of the opportunity I wanted to find next culture was near the top of the list .
O,Got it .
O,I really cared a lot about
O,defined culture for people who are founders and let's say they're not a 30 million yet but they're building towards that and how should they think about culture because it's a word that's kind of loaded right like culture .
O,Yeah .
O,The culture what culture .
O,You know again what does it mean practically .
O,You know we talk a lot about it as who we are are the kind of values that we exhibit right .
O,But the culture to me is sort of the sum of every interaction that happens among our teammates and our customers our partners in every hallway conversation and every meeting room every negotiation we do
O,that to me . It's how we show up in those moments .
O,Define your culture and it's their guardrails that you want to set up around that of like this is how we want to show up .
O,This is how we want to work with each other .
O,And I'll tell you I think that having a constant set of reinforcements of this is how we want to do it is really important and I would say you know all the founders and CEOs out there building companies institutionalizing those values is the only way to actually make those things real .
O,Otherwise they're really just you know the the posters on the wall in the cafeteria .
O,Yeah like motivational posters that are really just contrived .
O,Yeah but what I always see to dismiss
O,absolutely right is you'll walk you'll start walking past them and you'll never notice them again .
O,I look an iceberg
O,in our way often you know I think it's really important that that you embed them into your actual activities . David
O,how do you do that .
O,You said one humble and what was he in Hustle
O,happy happy okay .
O,We got hungry .
O,OK .
O,That's humble and honest .
O,So how do you get hungry what was it .
O,Happy .
O,Happy we got .
O,OK .
O,Hungry
O,hungry .
O,That's what I'm interested in .
O,Hungry
O,Hungry
O,humble .
O,How do you get those two too hungry and humble .
O,Yeah give me an example of how you make sure everybody's hungry and humble concurrently because you seem like two
O,and they are .
O,That's actually one of the beauties is sometimes you want some tension between the two but part of the thing that you that we found we had to do as an example .
O,If you really care about culture the people coming in the door and the people you are hiring if you're you know if you're in a startup the person you make an offer to next is probably the most important decision you made is a business that week .
O,And so what we did is said OK we care a lot about values we care a lot about recruiting and the talent we're bringing aboard to take that take the hill with us .
O,So we literally took each of the four ages wrote down a set of questions that we believe would help us elicit whether or not we thought that person aligned with our world view .
O,So you you created a questionnaire .
O,Yeah .
O,That your interviewers will do that align with the value .
O,Exactly .
O,I could give an example like for the humble do they know that there when those questions are being asked that they're a line there is that like just a little internal thing
O,all the interviewers and the interviewees do not .
O,So they're just answering questions answering questions so like as an example we would have won for the humble age . That would be you know Jason tell us a little bit about the professional accomplishment you are most proud of .
O,I'm the greatest angel investor of all time .
O,Everybody else is second to me and you would maybe not pass the bill exactly .
O,That's why I was in charge .
O,No but what we would do is ask that question .
O,We would ask that question and then literally the interviewer would sit back and just do a pronoun count how many times did the interviewee use the pronoun I versus we that would usually tell us everything we needed to know about whether or not they were going to fit in .
O,I have hit seven unicorns I have done an escape .
O,Exactly right .
O,There is no way .
O,There is no reason to joke .
O,No getting .
O,So that's fascinating .
O,So that's a way in . You have to operationalize
O,when you fire people and you dismiss them and you terminate them . Are you like pointing to them like you're not humble or at that point it's just that it's over
O,by that point we try to love people out with Grace you know
O,love people out with Grace unpack that .
O,Yeah .
O,I believe that at the end of the day if for whatever reason things don't work out between a company and a teammate it is going to be probably one of the worst days in that person's life and career .
O,And there's just that is not the time to be delivering hard and even if it's constructive feedback that we should have done months and months prior to that moment .
O,And if we didn't do that .
O,Shame on us .
O,But at that moment that is not the time to start time for love love and grace and you show them Grace and Grace means like you know are we going to explain to the entire team why so and so left the company .
O,We are not .
O,We are going .
O,Whatever reason that person wants to ascribe to their departure will be what we talk about probably because I know why they owe them Grace .
O,Now we now know why they gave you the reins of a 30 million dollar company .
O,You a considered thoughtful person .
O,Well
O,this is why we try on top right .
O,I'm not always asking me to run anything because I would be like oh you're fired .
O,Let me explain .
O,Oh staff lunch .
O,Explain all the reasons this person screwed up .
O,Now it is it is so tempting on the way out to want to help the person it is yeah . By telling him exactly how underwhelming their performance was .
O,Yeah but it's not .
O,But that's just not the time .
O,It's not that I had a great mentor of mine .
O,I've been so lucky to have many over the course my career and one of them said in the making that decision you need to be Spock like in the decision and Mother Teresa like in the delivery that and that and it's just a very simple .
O,And when you think about it that way you're like you're right you have to be dispassionate in making the call because it's hard and you just gotta be objective and is can I put somebody in that seat who is going to be better enable to help our company succeed and live up to our full potential .
O,The answer to that is yes you need to be Spock like in that decision .
O,You know when you have that communication or conversation with your teammate you've got to be Mother Teresa because that's going to be the worst news they've heard in a long time .
O,All right .
O,When we get back I want to know how you grew from 3 30 million when you took over so too at the exit . What was the revenue in the final quarter or the year 2018 revenue was how to ready or know
O,what your last public you our last budget I think we were probably the last public was probably north of one hundred and fifty million dollar run rate would be the weight 150 per quarter prior year per quarter record sorry per annualize for the year .
O,So for the year take you three times five extra .
O,Yeah a lot of that .
O,Right .
O,Amazing .

O,Welcome back to this week in startups .
O,It's our nine hundredth and something episode and Jackie Emmy Award winning producer Jack has committed that the next 100 episodes as we lead into number 1000 will be a unicorn investor CEO or founder each time Jackie what a challenge .

O,Incredible Jackie when you told me you were gonna get 100 unicorns for me in the next hundred episodes .
O,I was flabbergasted by the ambition stretch goals stretch goal
O,What a stretch goal .
O,The beautiful thing and it's so great to have seen Garrett on the program because we love and you sang great .
O,You may or may not know this you're at customers com is powered by grid and we love it's amazing .
O,I'll give you the look more fabulous .
O,We had many choices of who to go with .
O,Yeah and we did the heads up Bake Off the Jets and grid and the mighty Amazon Web Services San grid trounced it better delivery .
O,Yes better delivery better API better better documentation I everything all of us and the team is very humble .
O,Think when we speak to them and they're very helpful .
O,But a bunch of other agents .
O,It's awesome
O,but .
O,So so proud to hear that and thank them for doing that
O,but that is that brings up a good point .
O,When did a W ask because it was on your watch decide they would get into training categories called transactional e-mail your .
O,That where we started that's right that's why you start yeah when NWS came into that space what year were you in in your tenure and then what was that board meeting like cause you must have known they were gonna come eventually .
O,I think the team did again predated my arrival so if I went back and look I want to say it was 2012 look for a fact check it's either 20 left either late eleven or mid 2012 somewhere in that time zone
O,and they came into the market as you would imagine having had lots of conversations with the board and previous management team that was in oh blank kind of a day
O,that was an issue moment
O,yes .
O,Oh gosh oh gosh moment and what was remarkable coming out of it is that it fueled Sen. grid's growth it actually wasn't accelerate right .
O,Totally not what you rely on packet .
O,So here's what ends up happening
O,Amazon being a W.S. legitimizes the need for every developer on the planet to use a service like this
O,as opposed to rolling their own
O,as opposed rolling their eyes that that was your big competitor with somebody just throws up whatever email server whatever it is they like make it do this ourselves we'll just take a server do it do it yourself DIY we'll set up a couple of mail servers set up the SMP protocol we'll be all good and
O,and so they legitimized every developer needs one of these create a bunch of demand and awareness for the need and then the developers being awesome developers would say well I wonder if anybody else does this let me do a quick search they would find us and then compare the two and thankfully they all had the exact same experience that you did focus matters and then they would say oh wow these Syncrude folks have been doing exactly this and nothing about this for years that's all they're gonna do and you know we we're off to the races
O,this is we're in the competitive landscape let's keep pulling this the string a little bit and see where it leads us
O,MailChimp you know did man drill .
O,That's right .
O,The transactional email service we went head to head with you but then they cut they deprecated that I guess they shut it down or they got out of the business they got out of the business as a standalone service they still offer it to their marketing customers but in terms of a developer looking for transactional e-mail solution they got out of that business .
O,How would you describe MailChimp versus sand grid here in 2019 .
O,What are the differences between those two platforms .
O,I would say they're MailChimp kind of reverted to their roots as a email marketing provider and and I think you know I would say selfishly we would say or perhaps you know are in our world view recognize that we were we said grid we're going to continue to do what we do distinctively well and at a scale that would be hard for them to match and that they would be better served continue to focus on their core customer
O,as the marketer and to their great credit . We have immense respect for the MailChimp team
O,but they're going after marketers so they're going out to market so I want to build a database and have some beautiful templates I'll use MailChimp I'm a developer and I need to send whatever millions billions of transactional email every time you get a friend request every time you get a comment on a post a reminder whatever you're going to use and you know you said great .
O,And that was where .
O,So that's where we started and when I joined the company I would say to their credit manual had MailChimp team it done a nice job that gives GoPro innovated in some areas that where we were so busy scaling with our customers we're like little just to keep up with the service or didn't fall over because the demand was so great on it with more of our energy was going into scaling that it wasn't innovating manual added a couple a set of things that were interesting .
O,And I remember when I first joined it was my assessment that manual was sort of eating our lunch and the low end of the market in particular
O,they undercut us on price materially and they had a bunch of cool new features that we did not .
O,And so I remember when we saw in 2015 we set up a tiger team and said they had a one of those pages on their Web site that was you know the list of your all the capabilities manual check said grid X manual check said grid x .
O,And we said to the tiger team we want one of those to come down every month .
O,Wow .
O,And here's your roadmap is your roadmap .
O,Go take them down one by one and we're actually going down do you then call out and we literally had our man drill our .
O,Hey .
O,Yeah junk counsel called theirs and said that's no longer true .
O,Please please remove us no longer true because you're doing marketing like that and it's not factual .
O,All right factually correct .
O,Yeah that's not cool .
O,You can't do that .
O,So every month we are GC would make a call and say that's no longer true .
O,And about six months in they took the page down and then about nine months in is when they announced that they were gonna get out of the standalone market .
O,Let me ask you a question about because I don't understand all this stuff deliverability .
O,Yeah .
O,Now I am a huge fan of email yeah because I watched trying to make it work with Google search and being disintermediation .
O,Social media being dis intermediate .
O,And then apps like you're constantly YouTube .
O,The people who are running those ecosystems change the rules .
O,Yeah and you lose access to your actual customers that you build up .
O,I have friends and followers right .
O,They just upset fabricated immediately .
O,You know what screw it .
O,I'm gonna take you inside icon .
O,Yeah .
O,Make it email newsletter company .
O,Yeah .
O,And then I started wondering am I going to be at risk of g mail specifically Google and Gmail disintermediation hating me again .
O,And sure enough they put up these four tabs .
O,Yeah promotions forums social O show .
O,Yeah .
O,Was that a move to control marketing into the email box or in user's best interests are somewhere in between because the cynic in me believes that they were trying not just to make life easier for users but maybe negate people's ability to get in marketers ability to get into inboxes .
O,Yeah .
O,What do you think .
O,I .
O,I actually I j .
O,I think it genuinely came from a place of wanting to improve the user experience .
O,What we found that was remarkable was from the introduction of the tabs and we had as you would imagine lots of customers who were very concerned about it .
O,Sure .
O,Oh my gosh .
O,Where .
O,What's going gonna do to my open rates and I click through rates and that drives a lot of revenue for our customers .
O,And what was remarkable it actually didn't have a material impact for a couple of reasons .
O,One I think it's something on the order of about 60 something percent of the emails we deliver on behalf of our whatever our latest public number was seventy thousand I think was the latest public seventy four thousand paying customers another hundred and twenty thousand free customers .
O,They why would they go with that though deliverability 60 percent .
O,Oh that's 60 percent are opened on a mobile device .
O,Oh and you know what on a mobile device there are no tabs .
O,Yeah .
O,As it turns out .
O,Yeah .
O,And because just the form factor you can't if you don't do the taps and so and those that were on desktop it didn't have as big of an impact on open and click through rates because the people that really cared then were engaged with the brands they went down .
O,It does seem that those brands also when you email within when you interact with email and your promotions tab yeah or you're one of those other tabs that's not the inbox does it automatically g mail send it over to your main box .
O,That's something I've been trying to figure out .
O,So let's say you reached the techy everyday or inside San Francisco every day .
O,Yeah .
O,If you're opening it every day and it's in your promotions tab .
O,Yeah does it about does it automatically move it .
O,That's a good question .
O,They email much machine learning over there I'd be shocked if it didn't .
O,I know that from my own experience having used it .
O,It will .
O,It's like a very simple click to say moved to my to my my primary in primary to my primary inbox
O,email is having a huge resurgence .
O,Yes like the last year or two has been amazing how every startup and all these companies are saying we got to get back to email .
O,Yeah .
O,When we get back from a quick break I want to know what's behind that .
O,And then what kind of what is the value of an email subscriber vs. . Or an email address versus like say having a follower on a social network when we get back on this we can start ups

O,Fabulous .
O,My guest today Samir DAU lucky .
O,Good luck .
O,Still nail in Tokyo .
O,Is it still Indian or Pakistani
O,Indian .
O,It's India .
O,Parent born and raised in Mumbai India .
O,You're kidding .
O,They Wow they've been rare .
O,They may go immigrated to the states in the 60s and so that's where my brother and I were born and raised
O,really where just outside of Boston Massachusetts .
O,Wow .
O,Yeah how was that
O,rough .
O,It was rough .
O,Well I say roughly because you know there was Boston's rough and there wasn't a period there weren't a lot of Indian families around .
O,Let's put it that way .
O,Yeah stood out a little .
O,We said those Bostonian unique .
O,Yeah .
O,Butterflies .
O,There are just so graceful for your point of being graceful and gentle .
O,Yes .
O,Yeah they're very welcoming of new newcomers .
O,Absolutely .
O,I joke about that and I could I should say in all in all sincerity our particular neighborhood was amazing and our neighbors were awesome and they were very welcoming .
O,Yeah the broader community around us .
O,The town at large .
O,Yeah a little bit .
O,I was the brown the where's the brown kid at . One little ad literally try out .
O,So we asked Eric you know it was different .
O,It was a different moment in time now .
O,So true .
O,Your you're crushing it .
O,Do you buy into this .
O,I think a lot of my Indian friends will call it the curry ceiling .
O,Are you aware of this .
O,No I haven't heard that .
O,Yeah .
O,So Curry ceiling .
O,Yeah .
O,Not Steph Curry but I'd like a car like like arc like curry .
O,Yeah .
O,You ask me would call it in the 90s there was a belief in Silicon Valley yeah that Indians could send to you know really high position .
O,Yeah .
O,V.P. SVP Yeah but not his team .
O,Not so much .
O,Yeah .
O,Did you experience that coming up .
O,What did you feel like maybe
O,I didn't .
O,I was very fortunate you know singers my my second CEO job my first one I had ten ten or eleven years ago now and so I was fortunate that I didn't experience that .
O,But I think times are changing .
O,I think it helps that right now I was funny I was in fun trips I was in Italy over the summer with my family on vacation and I was in this at this resort and there was an investor that was hanging out in the pool and you know you start chit chatting Americans and foreign place start talking and he says you know I really hope I'm waiting for an Indian to take over Facebook because it worked out really well when Microsoft went Sundar took over Google and signed Satya took over Microsoft .
O,And so I was waiting for that and I just I had to laugh .
O,That's how I actually think Xbox doing all right .
O,But now I understand you do well actually back to your push .
O,Wow .
O,We found somebody in favor of the Xbox unique .
O,That's right .
O,What's your point of management style .
O,Yeah .
O,If you were going to pick a value yeah move fast and break things where would that be on your list
O,it's important to be on the list .
O,I think progress over perfection is something that I talk a lot about it at the joint company Twilio it's being nimble be nimble in those matter .
O,You know I would say we often start from a we not I had said teams do great things is humility first . Are customer centric .
O,You know we're here to serve our customers a bull in a china shop not not as probably not as prominent as the . Well sir we are here to serve our customers .
O,It was such a great when you think about it though in retrospect move fast and break things just gave everybody permission with just that one value . Yeah to not care about mistakes which you know if you break some . Who cares .
O,OK . Who cares now
O,however that served them so well on the way up and so poorly at scale .
O,I think it's a very interesting point .
O,There's a time and place for things and you're absolute like it drove a probably a set of innovations where small teams are moving at speed and that can be awesome .
O,And as you are at scale it can . It can be a little bit more dangerous and you've got to like taking rubles for racist ads against Hillary Clinton .
O,Yeah .
O,And I would be there or not .
O,Yeah I mean they literally spend more time I think on keeping competitors off the platform than they did looking at advertisers like why would we put any the cycles on slowing down people spending money .
O,Right .
O,Let's just kill our competitors by . I mean I see you saw that VPN thing they were doing studying .
O,No .
O,They basically bought a company on video or something as an Israeli company that would be a VPN and then they use the VPN .
O,They bought the company because the VPN was on so many phones that they knew exactly the utilization of Snapchat WhatsApp etc. .
O,So then they had the inside information of which apps to kill which ones to buy .
O,Which you know yeah it was pretty nefarious . Craziness .
O,Speaking of which how do you deal with that they know that was a mailchimp issue too in the beginning days .
O,Email is used for a lot of nefarious spear phishing phishing craziness spam obviously .
O,Yeah .
O,How do you when you're giving away the first free 10000 emails for free .
O,Like it's not one of the Tor offerings I get the first ten thousand bucks a day free .
O,How do you mitigate against Russian hackers spamming all that and how often are you attacked .
O,Yeah unfortunately all the time and I would say it's it's one of the reasons I believe singer has been so successful is we even we've invested over the past literally decade tons of both process and engineering two defense systems .
O,And and I think we built a brand and a reputation industry .
O,We if we actually will fire lots and lots of customers new sign ups that we do not believe are sending wanted mail like that's our catch phrase like
O,we only want to deliver wanted mail wanted mail means the recipient asked to get it and they're happy to be receiving it
O,like the open rates on our platform like we sent it by way just as a sense of scale . I think we sent something on the order of I got to go at last public number was north of 40 billion e-mails in a month over a billion emails every single day
O,our open rates are north of 20 percent .
O,That's a lot .
O,That's pretty great .
O,That's pretty pretty .
O,I mean retailers are getting 5 10 percent open rates
O,three to five . Yeah they'd be doing cartwheels .
O,Yeah .
O,So if we send wanted mail and we take we pride ourselves in that but we had to go build machine learning systems to go vet site people that are coming in to sign up and we would check a bunch of different variables and figure out does this look like digital .
O,Then we would we we check okay how we're going and let him send a little bit and then we're gonna go watch the engagement rates with their subscribers and we will open the funnel or the pipe yep if it's looking good .
O,And if it's looking really bad and people are getting flagged to spam we shut it down .
O,When I hit spam in Gmail or somebody hits it in there whatever mail client they're using Yahoo whatever does that day to get back to you somehow .
O,Is there a protocol and what is that protocol how does it work .
O,Yeah .
O,We actually partnered closely with with Google and then later Yahoo and other ISP is inbox service providers to create something we call the FPL .
O,The feedback loop and we literally said we all in this ecosystem have a aligned incentive to want to keep the bad actors out .
O,Nobody wants this spear phishing email you know Grandma is being taken advantage of you know spam flooding our inbox you can't actually get to the right one .
O,So we have a lot of data about who's who looks like a bad actor .
O,You all have a lot of data on who looks like a bad actor .
O,Let's create a feedback loop both ways .
O,And so we started that and then because you know you're trying to do the right thing like you know we should open this up to other ESPN email service providers that compete with Syncrude and the ISP is you know now provide that out to all the ESPN .
O,But I think it's helped immensely to cut down on spam and fish as a result over the last five years .
O,How did you get from 30 million or so to 150 million .
O,What does that take .
O,I mean I mean I guess the easy answer is like five years
O,lot of hard work .
O,Yeah we know when you come into a system you know like wow there's a big pile of cash now . The expectation is I grow it meaningfully . Yeah by the board
O,how do you do you make a five year plan .
O,You make a one year plan what's
O,what is that growth what's important in that growth phase .
O,Because that's a serious you know it's one thing to get a company of 10 20 million .
O,It's a whole nother thing to get to nine figures .
O,Yeah scaling scaling is hard and that growth stages is an interesting time and I would say we did think about it over for the next three to five years where do we want to be and then back . Walk yourself backwards from there .
O,And I believed then and thankfully we proved true .
O,I was like I believe this has the ability to be a built to last company
O,one proxy for that is can we be a public company would stand the scrutiny of the public eye be so disciplined in our operations that we can execute as a public entity
O,if we can do that and we have this grand vision that that that we have and you know that can fuel us for decades not just years then . Then we can keep going .
O,And so we've looked at that and then backed in and said OK well if that's true boy we got a lot of work to go do here .
O,And one of the challenges you'd ask really like why was I brought in you know make a CEO change of Everything's going perfectly .
O,The primary reason was our growth rate was decelerating year over year which happens you know kind of log very large numbers right .
O,It's easier to double when you're tiny and then that kind of thing .
O,But we were decelerating to to a growth rate that was in the 40s going to the 30s that might have been go into the 20s and we said we've we can't have that .
O,We got to arrest the deceleration and then re accelerate .
O,That's one of things I'm probably most proud of that we were able to accomplish in a couple few years after I joined was where we were able to flatten the curve .
O,We called the Sin smile because the growth rate went was going down and then we flattened it . And then we re accelerated and it looks like a
O,money is the key to that was it spending money on marketing was it they expanding the product offering was it reconstituting the team .
O,Wow you're good you should be a CEO as you choose not to be you're just hit . You just hit the probably the three biggest levers that we pulled .
O,In fact we more than tripled our marketing spend in that year .
O,What worked best .
O,Most of it was I would say the principle channel was still was SVM .
O,There's a reason Google is as big as they are .
O,Got it .
O,So that was that was a big part of it .
O,We added a new product line .
O,So you mentioned earlier you know we've been known for the transactional email with developers .
O,We added a second product line for the marketer .
O,And so now we do compete head to head with MailChimp and campaign mode .
O,What does that tell folks .
O,It's called marketing campaigns standard marketing campaigns and that's now a meaningful business line for us .
O,I'm trying again .
O,The last public number on it was probably a 25 million dollar run rate business that didn't exist .
O,So 10 15 percent already .
O,Yeah right .
O,And growing growing meaningfully faster than than the overall company average .
O,So that was a big part of it .
O,And then we did reconstitute the executive team we there's we have our general counsel that is the same from from the prior management team .
O,And then every other person was new and we . That was a difficult and long process I hired a new executive leader basically won a quarter for two years .
O,Wow .
O,And then they would come in and their domain experts and had seen scales part of the prerequisite to hire them was Have you seen scale have you been at a publicly traded company have you gone through this phase before .
O,And they could then come in and say we know what great looks like and I would just you know knowing what great looks like I think is critical to taking your team there .
O,You know because they're leading you now as opposed to you pushing people who've never been there .
O,That's like go to the New World like I've been to the New World I absolutely .
O,I took the ship around right .
O,We went around an old pawn .
O,We made it we made it back .
O,It's all good .
O,I've been there
O,and I love being the dumbest guy in the room in our executive management team meetings where I know my marketer or my product person or my CFO will know has forgotten more than I will ever know about how to do their job in that function .
O,And I think that was a big part of our success too .
O,I will right .
O,You decide .
O,You keep bringing up going public as was the mission there many Silicon Valley startups are staying private forever .
O,Yeah .
O,And I want to point out any companies that I'm a large meaningful shareholder and they have now in your tenure .
O,They filed but you zip zip zip .
O,Got this company all black and I want to find out why you did that and how you did it .

O,All right welcome back to this week in startup .
O,Samir is here .
O,He's the CEO of Sanger .
O,Previously you were at cloud performs group at Citrix .
O,Now remember Citrix Yeah that's like where you could Citrix servers allowed you to do remote work .
O,Yeah exactly .
O,Back in the day I was like it started in the 9:00 late 90s didn't it .
O,Like people were doing these like lawyers were taking out their laptop .
O,Exactly yeah .
O,Like so you could remote desktop .
O,That's right remote desktop virtualize applications run one instance of an app and it would yeah it would be remote thing into the app .
O,Yeah .
O,And then later it became remote into your full desktop environment which was a virtual desktop infrastructure .
O,Yeah I remember putting in some of the first Citrix servers in New York back in the day for law firms and what it was actually was a rack in a closet somewhere that each card was a P.C. and they would dial and it would just put them on the next P.C. and then it would be doing screen drawing .
O,Yeah .
O,And it wasn't very good because depending on what hotel you're in the connection it might not and if you were on dial up .
O,Yeah is on 28 .
O,Back what I've back in the day that was particularly hard for them actually
O,Citrix ended up buying a networking company because that was part part of the experience with the network problem . They're like well sorry our fault we don't own the network .
O,And then it became clear well we own the customer experience we go solve that problem anyways .
O,But but yes we did that to
O,so you decided to go public or the board decided this when they hired you that was part of the prerequisite .
O,They wanted a CEO who wants to go public or .
O,No not at all .
O,I think I would say they just cared to and I was and I would say my my intention as well was how do I help this company fulfill its potential .
O,And I believed that that meant we were going to scale we were gonna be a publicly traded company someday that we've got a path to build a billion dollar revenue business not a billion dollar market cap business .
O,Right .
O,And sort of necessarily over that period time for us I figured we would end up going public but it was never the goal .
O,And you know we would say that to you know all of our teammates all the time
O,the IPO is it's just a milestone marker on the journey it's not the death
O,but certainly for you because we grew up I think in the same era similar ages being taking a company public was the dream of all executives just like that was .
O,Yeah .
O,Even though it's a milestone .
O,It was a major mile .
O,It's a major milestone .
O,I'm not going to lie .
O,There's no question I'll tell you .
O,I reflect on my career . One of the most fun and inspiring moments was certainly having a huge team of Sen graders and front of the New York Stock Exchange .
O,People we took out we flew out everyone who had been at Stanford for more than four or five years because our view is well they're the people who actually built this place brick by brick and I want them there to celebrate with .
O,We had everybody on the stock on the stock exchange floor .
O,We were doing chants we do this callback I say send you say grid send credits and grid Superfund and you get and we Lily made so much noise that Jim Cramer is like what is going on back there .
O,Who are these people like .
O,But we had a blast and it was it was f without question was a an emotional high and a certainly you know a great milestone .
O,Is it a mistake for these companies to say private so long in your mind .
O,The thing that I believe what's the downside .
O,You know there's a lot of overhead that certainly comes with being public .
O,There's a lot more regulatory stuff .
O,You get the old socks you have .
O,There are a whole set of reasons that people argue stay out of being a public company .
O,I would argue and I know there are some very noted venture capitalists who would agree that say you know I think companies that go public end up maturing faster and have to because they're under the scrutiny of the public eye and you just get better and all those all those things that they require of us . You put in controls you put in process checks you those are actually really important and good things . If you want to scale a great business for a long long time .
O,So I actually think there's a lot that you're referencing I think Bill Gurley who is just like your guy staying if you want to grow up and be a big company and like take the medicine .
O,Yeah it's not the worst thing in the world .
O,It's not like they have function .
O,Yeah .
O,Oh is it .
O,It's a forcing function to go get mature .
O,Right .
O,Because you need to have a CFO who's done it before .
O,You need to have a number two for that CFO who's done it before wants to do it again or whatever .
O,Yeah absolutely .
O,Yeah .
O,What was it like cause you . Republic for how long before this Twilio acquisition Let's go around third base here and to Twilio buying the company or merging or whatever it's considered .
O,Yeah .
O,We got to we didn't even quite get out a year .
O,So we went public November 15th of 2017 and we announced the acquisition October 15th of 2018 .
O,Now this is all public .
O,Yeah .
O,In the US four filings
O,we had had conversations about bringing the companies together earlier before we went public .
O,Right .
O,That's obviously a window in time where people say well before we go to do that you know we better call them and see if they're interested and you know we had some interesting conversations with with the Twilio team at the time and quite serious ones and you know I think all the reasons why we ultimately got together were true then as well .
O,Like we had a common vision of OK customers need to be able to communicate with their users across lots of communication channels not just email or not just as a mess or not as voice but they need them all right .
O,And so we had a very common vision .
O,We both we had a common model where like we're gonna go through developers
O,Yeah .
O,Which is a very different go to market model .
O,Yeah .
O,That's a last decade thing where the developers are making the decisions from the grass about it with their credit card as opposed to top down with some CIO CIO .
O,Right .
O,See you and I did grow up in the same garage and like CIO would come down and play God .
O,That's right .
O,Some with some account executive tricks and that's right .
O,Then everybody in I.T. from the bottom up had to implement would just follow whatever they decided and they'd be like I can't believe we're doing Banyan vine .
O,Why didn't we go with ethan and I were doing whatever the CIO told me to do .
O,So but so that change in model we're totally uncensored are perfectly aligned on the model developer led model .
O,And then our culture is so aligned .
O,So there is plenty of reasons why it made sense to go to get together before the IPO .
O,And candidly the only reason we we didn't affect it then was just we couldn't make the math work like this .
O,You know what they could afford and what we were willing to sell for .
O,You know we just didn't line up .
O,There was no there's no overlap .
O,One of the great things about going public is you actually then get ground truth and reality .
O,There's no there's no debate then about what the value the company is the market has now said it right a clearing price and you could argue the entire market's wrong .
O,But .
O,And so that is in fact when Jeff and I revisited our conversation .
O,That was a big part of the Army is like well not going to be as much of a debate on the valuation because the market has now set it whereas before we had a lot of debate over what it could be worth as a private company .
O,And you both have the existential threat of going into each other's markets UPS and Amazon coming into yours .
O,That's right .
O,Also just so it's at a certain point consolidation . Yeah I mean strength
O,better together better to gather better together .
O,Sure .
O,Yeah .
O,And when you look at those cloud players why should somebody pick sort of the smaller player over the bigger one
O,because that was always when I was in I.T. like you can't get fired for going Microsoft .
O,Yeah it is insane that Microsoft does not own cloud computing and Amazon does
O,that is surprising as it's not what you would have picked in 1998
O,the book seller beat . Yeah the I they have the software just software giant has been incumbent since 1980 .
O,It makes no sense .
O,Yeah .
O,Disruption and innovation innovator's dilemma .
O,But I do think that a big part of the reason that we do get chosen is because it is as well as you just described .
O,It's no longer the CIO top down .
O,It is the developer bottoms up and the developer just wants the best tool . The best building block that they need to solve the problem that's in front of them while they're building their app .
O,And I just say you know with with all of my humility I don't think there's any question that Twilio and Zen Grid are the leading platforms for the areas that we serve .
O,And that's just not close with you compare them head to head even with the with the Amazon Web Services of the world
O,is interesting to Twilio when they came out they came out with three years ago maybe two or three years ago and they went public .
O,It's been a little bit .
O,Oh yeah that's right yeah .
O,They came out .
O,They've really had a great run .
O,Yeah .
O,It came out .
O,Yeah .
O,That's a particularly strong company .
O,It's incredible .
O,It's a great it's a great business one that we're really excited to be joining .
O,That's great .
O,It's just a great combination .
O,It really is like I really believe that Jeff on the podcast I think twice .
O,And he's an amazing leader and I'll tell you you know he's also a culture .
O,I mean it does make sense now because he's a very culture centric kid .
O,I would if I were to say thoughtful he would come to mind .
O,Yeah you're both very thoughtful and it's a huge part of the reason why we were able to come together as we sat around my kitchen table drinking Japanese whiskey together talking about the criticality of culture and values and we had conversations before we ever got into the numbers around . Okay let's talk about where we're similar and more importantly let's talk about where we're different and how is that going to work .
O,And would this work .
O,And because we're both very we care talking about you know the people aspect of leadership and building a great company .
O,And I'd say that part of the reason we ended up together was a a deep and genuine belief that we have an opportunity to go build an iconic company that is like one for the generations
O,like this is not a an interesting solid software business .
O,This is one that can be one of the greats .
O,It does seem that way .
O,You .
O,Where were you guys based were you based in Boulder or Denver .
O,Where were you were San grid .
O,Where did they wind up .
O,Because I know they were in Boulder for some very time and they weren't doing anything here where did they where's the headquarters .
O,You know it's funny .
O,I would say the company is based largely in Denver by headcount so we have 70 percent of our teammates 350 of our 450 employees are in Denver Colorado .
O,We we had offices in Boulder and Denver we just combined everybody into debt holders are too small to have a company with more than 50 people right there's like three buildings in Boulder
O,Boulder's gorgeous .
O,It's a beautiful with three office buildings capable of holding like 16 people if
O,to all my my Boulder friends listening I would say in their defense . Google has a giant actually complex out there now I think they've got a thousand people in Boulder now so you can build scale there .
O,It just for us it just so happened that the scale that we were building at we were able to more readily access talent that we needed in Denver .
O,So we made the decision wait five minutes though it's not it's not too bad .
O,Yeah it's it's sort Yep that's right .
O,And it worked out great for us so we thought that's where we had the majority .
O,We have another office down in Irvine in Southern California .
O,Oh perfect .
O,Our founders all three of those guys Isaac Tim knows they were Southern Cal guys .
O,So they after we got got things started in Denver once they hired the professional CEO the first guy they went back to home effectively and then set up shop there and then I joined the Bay Area guy lived down in Menlo Park .
O,And so we set up a shop in Redwood City and now we've got 50 or 60 people there
O,and that is the state of the art right .
O,Like having multiple offices you can draw from multiple townhouses you can't do it here .
O,It's really hard .
O,It's our just go .
O,Yeah it's I think it's just harder if you know as you keep scaling .
O,I think you take advantage of diverse talent pools in this you know the world is flat kind of world it makes sense to have other other places .
O,What do you think about these like closed border Trump madness like being somebody who benefited from coming from India .
O,Yeah .
O,We're your parents you know .
O,You know it's funny we talk a lot about you know where where I draw the lines or what I talk about publicly when I don't etc. .
O,And then I actually picked up the microphone on the immigration stuff yeah . You know year year and a half ago obligated .
O,And yeah for that very reason I just I believe deeply and passionately this country was built by immigrants and had it so intricately woven into how this country was built and why we've been successful we want to continue to be a place that attracts the best and brightest and most ambitious talent in the world and putting up walls to send them somewhere else does not intuitively make sense to me .
O,And so immigration policy that still allows for that and may have other aspects of it I'm open and that's all fine .
O,But but what I worry about is we go so extreme that we throw the baby out with the bathwater .
O,Yeah that's dangerous
O,way too extreme and the rhetoric against people and this entire concept that this wasn't a melting pot like assimilation was when we grew up a jewel . They were like yeah they indoctrinated into us that you assimilate when you come to America . Yeah you're no longer a Greek Yeah Irish or an Indian .
O,Yeah you're an Indian American you're Greek American .
O,That's right .
O,And then you're an American .
O,I guess it just takes two generations .
O,That's right .
O,What a fabulous experiment America has been holding and a solidified common culture .
O,Yeah and now we we're like we'll know our culture is not their culture .
O,It's like no it's always been assimilated bean and melt into the pot and it makes for a beautiful diverse averse soup that like true that was what you were a success .
O,That was what got taught as kids yeah in the classroom .
O,That's exactly what we were taught melting pot .
O,I mean that phrase must have been used thousands of times as you know grown up and now people are like wow how that everybody except anybody .
O,And I think even people think assimilation is bad
O,assimilation just means kind of agreeing on a common culture that we share these principles who share these principles .
O,Yeah .
O,And now you can't even get a developer from a lot of countries into America right .
O,I'm Yeah .
O,Oh hiring you know getting the getting folks over an age when BS is always spent so much time and money on the legal process for that it's hard to do it .
O,And and you know you know we want to attract the best talent and I haven't thought about opening an office in Canada like we did in order to right around this issue because you know in Canada . Yeah they're like oh you want to come here .
O,Yeah .
O,Open doors yes .
O,All right .
O,Five data yeah .
O,Six days .
O,They just literally give people visas in days .
O,That's incredible
O,no we haven't done Canada yet .
O,I send grid to think about it whether Twilio has or not .
O,With wait Leo's got about I think we now collectively have about 20 sites around the world .
O,So we do have sites now all over the place that we can attract and those talent pools which is great .
O,But think we've done Kennedy out for that for that specific reason .
O,But it is it's an issue for . For Pete for people in tech and software trying to hire great talent .
O,You know the immigration issues are alien particularly nefarious about it too and it impacts Indians in a major way is a lot of the .
O,I remember when I was in I.T. in the 90s which you were in as well .
O,Yeah it was the H1 b visa even as constructed if we have them is very heavy handed with immigrants
O,if they lose their job yeah they have to go back have to go home .
O,Yeah and they have what 30 days I think it is like a short window and they were hiring Indians specifically to pay them lower rates and then have this over their heads that they you know if they then we'll send you back to your country and your kids .
O,Yeah .
O,So can you imagine like Indian Americans coming here to do the right thing for their kids and having it lord it over to them why would there be a 30 day .
O,That was crazy .
O,I mean you couldn't even sell your home and book flights in 30 days .
O,How would anybody uproot them .
O,Yeah no it's it's a that tactic and it was yeah it's a retention a retention policy that is important .
O,It's abhorrent .
O,And I remember almost every conversation was can we pay them less .
O,And it's like why .
O,Well it's the same work .
O,Why would you be paying them less because they're brown right .
O,Like in people's mind like oh they're from India .
O,Brown kid from Boston who cares about their future .
O,Insane Yeah I think we've I think we've made progress .
O,We've come a long way since then but we've got a long way to go .
O,Yeah if you think about it can you imagine if Satya and some da da like weren't allowed into the country right .
O,Elon Musk Right .
O,Or Sergei like .
O,IZRAEL immigrants leave right .
O,I believe not in our generation definitely .
O,Second yeah I think there are but I think you're right .
O,I think they might all I know they they're all first gen or I think they're all first generation and there's a need to fact check that
O,when you look back on this whole journey what would you change what was the biggest mistake you made if you go back in time and whisper in your ear like hey go harder here go faster don't do this you must be looking back on and saying well went well oh yeah all's well that ends well .
O,But there's got to be a lesson or two a mistake or two that yeah actually we should get a a mulligan on what are the .
O,You know let's say the big mulligans I would say I would be more aggressive going faster on the product expansions the opportunities the the success we've seen with our marketing product has been bonkers .
O,Like so far outstripped expectations .
O,You know even more than 10000 paying customers using the thing is incredible .
O,And it's because we built this beautiful simple brand new application versus much of what's available on the market that's been around for 15 years and it looks at .
O,And so having something like and we put it on top of one of the world's largest sending engines right .
O,Yes .
O,Geils we had half of the work done .
O,Yeah .
O,Oh we had 1 percent of the work done easily .
O,And so I wish we would've gone harder on it faster .
O,It's probably one .
O,It's hard when you're in a big company you've got a big money printing machine .
O,Yeah .
O,To then be like let's build a machine because you have this machine that's printing a hundred dollar bills and it's like let's build this little machine over here that breaks down and it spits out a quarter every two days .
O,Yes like it doesn't get the attention right .
O,It doesn't nail your first thing . The gravitational pull to whatever your first act is this would be you know if I were to offer you know my my two rupees of wisdom to any any of the CEO founders out there listening I would just say Gosh you're asked to think about act two sooner than you think .
O,And I know everybody you know common law is state focused and get your act one and don't get distracted and all those things .
O,If you feel like you've got a trajectory as we knew we did getting started on act two and really putting the building the next business will take you three to five years to get it to be of scale .
O,And as you scale it is law of large numbers for it to be meaningful .
O,It can't be a five million dollar business .
O,It's got to be a 50 million dollar business for it to matter . Three to five years from now .
O,So you just gotta get going on that suffer .
O,This is Microsoft's big conundrum .
O,They were like Yeah we need something that has a billion dollars in earnings .
O,If we're going to buy it it's all right .
O,I'm sorry we have to be at all not a billionaire .
O,I mean like I just got to have a billion dollars of earnings to even move to move the needle to move the needle .
O,You know what hands linked in canceling Danzig one of the few things that could actually be at that school perhaps .
O,Hey one thing we left unfinished during the breaks was why is email had a resurgence .
O,What is it about email that makes it so so resilient .
O,Yeah and why is it having the resurgence .
O,I think email is a channel that will outlive us all .
O,Mark my words
O,it is the number of times your email is dead .
O,I think that's happened about five subsequent times over the last 20 years and every time that has been wrong .
O,Yeah and I'll tell you why I think that's true .
O,Number one it has ridiculous reach is virtually ubiquitous .
O,There are . That came from the exact number off on me and I would say something on the order of 6 billion unique email addresses on the planet .
O,The average person has one and a half or two of them .
O,So you have got 3 or 4 billion people that have one of these things .
O,And as I said now and it made the jump over to Mobile from desktop .
O,So that was one of the things that was going to kill e-mail .
O,Yes you're going to go from desktop to mobile and I'll said you're done here .
O,Guess which application is most often used on the on the on your smartphone .
O,Your e-mail vibrates from any of our about .
O,So it has incredible reach .
O,It's super ubiquitous .
O,It made the mobile jumpsuits in your pocket . Now at all times
O,people check it a gazillion times a day and it's super cost effective
O,relative to all these other channels and you can go spend with Google on ECM or Facebook on social advertising etc. The cost to send emails is dramatically lower so your are a Y .
O,So like there are all these studies done yet like a 38 dollar return for every dollar you put into an email program and when they compared it to say you know online social advertising with facebook or something else email was like Get the stat wrong .
O,It was like three to five times higher are y more efficient because it's so it's it's so cost effective .
O,Yeah .
O,So they're a bunch of reasons why .
O,And by the way we did our own serving of like the gent always like frenzy because that was the other argument .
O,You can have an e-mail address no kid no none of these teenagers are always texting etc cetera you have a phone number .
O,I have a 12 year old a 9 year old .
O,They've had emails for four or five years now because daddy runs an email company . But because every time they go to sign up for an application at school .
O,Yeah .
O,You know they have to use Google Chrome dot and online all those things require an email address .
O,Yep to sign up for the app you want to go use the school app or that school app they ask . It is the online identifier of choice today globally for every application .
O,Still the thing that we all rely on
O,is your digital identity .
O,Yeah and it's open source like .
O,Nobody owns it right .
O,Okay so you look at like the number . People will switch physical home addresses more more than they will there .
O,There that is 100 percent true .
O,I keep Jason Calacanis Stockholm . Yeah for a while .
O,Yeah first name .
O,Nice name .
O,I don't think I'm giving it up any time soon .
O,Well this ends right .
O,Samir .
O,What a great discussion .
O,A lot of wisdom in there on running these company companies and congratulations I know it's been a big long road and
O,thank you .
O,I appreciate coming on and doing the victory lap as it were .
O,So we'll get to sleep a little bit .
O,Not really .
O,Oh no sleep .
O,We had we just had our day one our first day . Oh and the transaction closed on Friday and it was a huge celebration lots of fun and a ton of energy and excitement .
O,Yeah I really we feel like we are accelerating not slowing down the opportunities just got that much bigger .
O,Are you gonna keep the company separate for a little bit or how does that integration work . Just figuring that out now
O,we've been figuring out over the last three months .
O,It was interesting when we first started we thought we're going to keep them totally separate right .
O,And then as we got through the integration planning .
O,Well that's really silly .
O,There are a lot of places here where we really should stitching together a little bit more closely sooner .
O,And then there are other places where we want to keep running a speed and a different path and that's solely fine .
O,And so we've been passing that over the last three months and I think have a ton of clarity on that now .
O,And now we have got to run
O,so great when you can just log in to for a developer to log into one account and you log into your Twitter account . You sang great stuff pop up and vice versa .
O,Yeah that's gonna take a little bit of time to build that data . I'd log in but yeah you know if I log in is gonna be great . We have these two different data sets in .
O,Yeah yeah yeah .
O,If you can reconcile all that and help customers like stitch together a digital profile for every one of their users like so that they know that sameer at gmail dot com is the same as the cell Phi I went to went to genius and GDP are good for your business bad for your business .
O,Good for the industry bad for the industry all this like you know pretty intense right is is
O,it is a very heavy lift for the industry generally .
O,What I would say about it Jason's I think it it impose a discipline that was probably good around how we treat and protect personnel PII and personal percent identified information so I think that part was good .
O,I think you know there's a lot there that prevents some things where you could drive innovation that would actually help the user experience because you can't as a as a provider and we see 3 billion tweets we send an email to over 3 billion unique email recipients every quarter .
O,Yeah that's more than half of the world's online population .
O,It's a ridiculous number .
O,We could with with all of that insight be able to do a lot more for any individual customer if we were allowed to use the learnings across it .
O,Right .
O,But GDP are you in you know has some guardrails that prevent you from doing that stuff so .
O,So I think it is good good with it the game better that the game feels like we expect .
O,Yeah .
O,Feels like the U.S. regulate the U.S. framework maybe too light .
O,GDP are too tight .
O,I think that's probably right .
O,It's probably somewhere in between the two .
O,Yeah
O,it does seem like some Web sites where even like you know what .
O,If you come from an IP address in Germany or yeah in London or Paris they were just like get . No not for you .
O,Yeah .
O,I think they've resolved most of that but a lot of people were just like we don't really need the European traffic sorry .
O,Yeah because that was too much of a lift .
O,This is too much work . Yeah just service to try to comply .
O,Yeah .
O,With .
O,And those 15 percent of users were probably not monetizing anyway .
O,It's sort of hilarious when you think about it like yeah we don't need that part of the where .
O,Yeah no .
O,Bad for Europe .
O,Yeah .
O,But I think we're we've both companies totally uncensored invested a ton to make sure we were GBR compliant is actually now kind of an advantage for us because we're at scale enough that we could make that investment .
O,And say we welcome all customers from around the globe .
O,Yeah .
