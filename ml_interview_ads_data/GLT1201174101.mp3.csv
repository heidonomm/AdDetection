O,Happy New Year .
O,Thank you .
O,Happy New Year to you .
O,We're back .
O,"We are D-WV New Year's resolutions , you know ."
O,Last year I said I wanted to get knocked down at an end of getting .
O,Huh ?
O,"Your exercise flat , which was the tick of box ."
O,It's somebody with Dec 0 .
O,"I mean , I did do a boxing for a while and I kind of fell off and I have every knock you out ."
O,"Nobody knocked me out mostly , you know , like you in the kisser ."
O,It wasn't really sparring .
O,It was more just like getting the technique .
O,That's the thing .
O,"All the things that seem like they'd be cool , like when I was a kid , I relate Star Wars thing took like three fencing classes in Philadelphia ."
O,"And they're like , OK , so we're going to do six months of footwork and then we'll give you a glove ."
O,Why couldn't I have just walked into the gym and then just someone immediately punches me ?
O,That's a veteran gym .
O,You really you have no New Year's resolutions ?
O,"No , I don't want to do a resolution this year because I feel like I failed so badly getting knocked out ."
O,What about you ?
O,Do you have a New Year's resolution ?
O,"Last year , I think my resolution was to be more confrontational ."
O,All right .
O,How'd it go ?
O,"Well , I think for a second I confronted more people in the last year ."
O,"What I remember is like a couple weeks ago , I was driving and this guy took my parking spot like I was backing into it ."
O,And he swooped in and took it as a dude .
O,"And he was like , oh , I was looking out my window and I saw this parking spot ."
O,I really wanted it .
O,"And I was like , OK , make sense as driveway ."
O,"I was like , that made no sense ."
O,That's great .
O,Great .
O,You've gotten way more conversational .
O,Okay .
O,So I guess this year by my New Year's resolution is to stand up for myself again .
O,Wait .
O,"Actually , I just realized that ."
O,"My Glaziers year's resolution , that was actually that it was actually an old resolution ."
O,My last year's one was to engage in less feuds .
O,"Oh , right ."
O,Yeah .
O,And it didn't work out .
O,Who are you feuding with ?
O,"You know , I think you should now ."
O,Okay .
O,No resolutions .
O,Nothing .
O,There's not one thing you want to have in this year .
O,This name is Sullivan Berman thing .
O,Zip .
O,Zero .
O,"All right , after ."
O,"This feels I feel like every time I just feel like you don't realize it , but you're setting me up ."
O,I don't I don't think I ever study of all the times .
O,I think sometimes there's any .
O,I don't think that's fair .
O,I know that that's the thing that's so frustrating about it is my answer .
O,"This honestly , it's going to be hard for you to resist like making fun of me ."
O,"Well , let's try ."
O,All right .
O,OK .
O,It doesn't make like an album of synthesizer music .
O,It's it's on that track .
O,OK .
O,I really want to be able to automate several parameters on many synthesizers simultaneously from one central digital audio workstation so that I can make them all all play autonomously .
O,And I can edit the parameters so that the filter moves that have a specific time or like the decay changes if you steal your resolution from a robot midi .
O,CSC is really difficult and I'm trying to learn it .
O,"If it makes you happy , I support you ."
O,"See , I knew it ."
O,"Like I said , if it makes you happy for you ."
O,"You said that after you thought about it , but it is that is the thing I'm focused on learning this year ."
O,If it makes you happier .
O,"Honestly , I feel like you have a better chance learning this obscure nerdy thing that I do it change my personality even one degree ."
O,"So probably next year , well , we can open a show with some weird synthesizer music and I'll still be feuding non-confrontational with the world ."
O,Fair enough .
O,"And it's not that it's not that obscure , huh ?"
O,All right .
O,"Before we start the show , one bit of housekeeping , because we've heard from people about this ."
O,Yes .
O,We didn't do our year end extravaganza this year .
O,"Pastors and future , past , present , future for anybody who's listening is the end of the year show where we sort of go over updates of episodes that have happened in the past year or several past years ."
O,And I didn't realize how beloved it was until we didn't do it .
O,Me neither .
O,"And as we've said in the past , we don't do it on years that are the beginning of a new decade , but we do it every other year ."
O,This is very convenient lie you've just made .
O,"Now , we just got busy with the big end of your series , but we're gonna do it again next year and in the next few months ."
O,There are some stories that we've reported that have had really interesting developments in them .
O,So we're gonna do some updates even though it won't be in one big end of year extravaganza .
O,"We will be looking back a little bit , but we've learned our lesson ."
O,We'll do it at the end of the year .
O,We're sorry for disappointing you .
O,OK .
O,Enjoy the show .
O,Enjoy the show .
O,From gimlets is Raphael APJ vote .
O,And I'm Alex Cohen .
O,"Alex Blumberg , yes , welcome to the studio ."
O,Thank you .
O,Hi .
O,Welcome once again to yes .
O,Yes .
O,No .
O,"The segment on the show where our boss , Alex Bloomberg comes to us with something he doesn't understand from the Internet ."
O,We do our best to explain it to him .
O,And sometimes we succeed .
O,Sometimes we don't .
O,"Man , that was the best one you've ever done ."
O,"Yeah , that was a concise I find no fault in that explanation ."
O,That was amazing .
O,"Thanks , guys ."
O,Five years in .
O,You can't just let it be .
O,All right .
O,"So , yeah ."
O,"So I am after five years of doing this with you guys , I now understand the Internet perfectly ."
O,So I no longer have any questions .
O,"But sometimes what I do is I send out a tweet to my legions and legions and legions of followers , confused followers and confused followers ."
O,"And I ask them , hey , can I help you with with some answers to some of your questions ?"
O,And people respond by sending me and sending me tweets that are confusing .
O,Can we just burst this fiction right now that you understand what's going on on the Internet ?
O,Yes .
O,Okay .
O,Thank you .
O,I don't understand what's going on the Internet .
O,Still less now than in the beginning somehow .
O,"You know , I feel like there there was like I it's there's like a steady increase in your understanding of things ."
O,"And then in it like crested and then dropped off really sharply because you like I don't know , because life got in the way ."
O,We really .
O,Yeah .
O,I feel like he started understanding stuff more for a minute .
O,Yeah .
O,And then it went away .
O,I feel like you're talking about Alex Womersley .
O,He's a child in a development toal phase or something .
O,He wasn't a developmental phase .
O,"I mean , I think starting the Internet , you know , like I was for for you know , you got really smart there for a minute ."
O,Now he's he's up worse off than when he started the .
O,OK .
O,So here's the tweet .
O,Yeah .
O,You ready ?
O,Yeah .
O,All right .
O,It's from Twitter user Dave Jorgensen verified .
O,And it says the teen Vogue article is going to come back as Troy Becker .
O,And this one is really good .
O,I was do you understand this sweet ?
O,I'm at exactly 50 percent comprehension .
O,"Alex , where do you understand this tweet ?"
O,No .
O,"PJ Vogt , you understand this tweet ?"
O,Yes .
O,So we're at .
O,"Yes , 50 percent now ."
O,Yes .
O,Now .
O,"So this is one of the ones that I sort of like where like I understand every word individually , but together they make no sense ."
O,"Well , I don't actually understand every word ."
O,I understand almost all the words except for the words .
O,Troy Becker .
O,Okay .
O,That is .
O,"And I assumed that was a football player for some reason I was like , that sounds like a sound like it does ."
O,Sounds like .
O,It sounds like a sports man of some kind .
O,It sounds like a quarterback or it sounds like like a weird code for Tribeca or or the kid who beat you up in high school .
O,"Yes , it does ."
O,Only the kid who beat me up in high school .
O,Yeah .
O,His name is Phil Zandy .
O,Zandy Crab .
O,Zandy Crab was your bully .
O,Yeah .
O,"Well , Zahedi Crab was somebody else's bully ."
O,Yeah .
O,"Then that's how they were up the food chain , really bullied by a nerd who got bullied by slightly more cool nerds ."
O,So that was I was like standing up to this guy who would be messing with me .
O,"And I was like I was like , finally say our resolve ."
O,And then a much cooler kid was there and he just pull up .
O,"A jury was like , nerd fight ."
O,"Oh , that's so ."
O,"Oh , I mean , I had it's like you can't even be like even when you're standing up for yourself , when you're taking a stand , you're you're immediately de-legitimise by some third party spectator ."
O,"Oh , that's awful ."
O,All right .
O,The tweet .
O,The tweet .
O,Okay .
O,"So , Goldman , I'm ."
O,What .
O,What is your .
O,Where did where's your 50 percent in the street ?
O,My 50 percent is the Teen Teen Vogue article .
O,Okay .
O,Let's start there .
O,"Alex Woolery , are you familiar with , like , you know , the whole thing that happened to Teen Vogue in the past couple years ?"
O,I interviewed for this other podcast that I that I host called Without Fail .
O,I interviewed Alain Well-trod .
O,"Oh , cool ."
O,Who is the editor of Teen Vogue ?
O,"And sort of like oversaw , it's sort of like somewhat surprising to many people transition from like , you know , beauty tips and secrets for teens to sort of like cogent political analysis of our current moment ."
O,I didn't know you interviewed her .
O,That's right .
O,Yeah .
O,"I was like that was like the big sort of like post Trump thing was like , yeah ."
O,Teen Vogue became sort of like politically progressive in vogue .
O,I think a lot of people first .
O,Right .
O,This is sort of funny .
O,Then I got you're gonna do a good job .
O,All right .
O,"Welcome , Teen Vogue ."
O,Did like thoughtful progressive Internet .
O,Right .
O,And then the magazine version got shut down .
O,"And they just became a Web site and it became obvious , you know that ."
O,Yeah .
O,"So this week , Teen Vogue posted an article that had a title like These Women Are Securing Facebook for the 2020 Election ."
O,How Facebook is helping ensure the integrity of the 2020 election .
O,How Facebook is helping ensure the integrity of the 2020 election .
O,Subhead With the company's huge platform comes huge responsibility and everybody read it .
O,"An immediate was immediately was like , this is very fishy ."
O,This is very puff p.c .
O,It feels like sponsored content .
O,It does .
O,And it sounds like a press release .
O,It felt like a press release .
O,"It was like a glowing profile , like five women who work at Facebook ."
O,"It was just like , you know , in an environment where most people at this point don't feel good about Facebook , particularly when it comes like safeguarding elections ."
O,"It was just article culture , just like Facebook ."
O,They're doing a great job .
O,Everybody knows that .
O,Let's talk to them about what a great job they're doing and the great people who are doing a great job there .
O,Who would ever feel a different way ?
O,What else would you say in an article like this ?
O,"And was there any reference to the fact that , like , Facebook was implicated in a lot of like sort of like trolling and Russian botting and like sort of like problems in 2016 , any of that stuff ?"
O,No .
O,It was like the article that Facebook would have written about itself in a world where people had access to no other news sources .
O,And it also came and had 90 day memories .
O,Yes .
O,Yes .
O,And it also came in a week when a memo was leaked that was written by someone who is pretty high up at Facebook .
O,What is his name ?
O,Boss cosworth .
O,Yeah .
O,Bosworth .
O,His name is .
O,So when he's the one name .
O,Eiswert .
O,Andrew Bosworth .
O,Yeah .
O,Just what I wanted to just be like .
O,"Yeah , like Haseler ."
O,That's my Facebook .
O,I'm above probably the burner .
O,"So Andrew Bosworth wrote a memo that was meant to be internal and and got leaked it like just it was very mealy mouthed , but essentially said like , we're not we're not going to change anything really ."
O,We're not going to disallow politicians from lying on our platform .
O,We're not going to stop accepting political ads .
O,And like the really sort of spectacular admission he made in the memo was like he said .
O,Do I think that Donald Trump won his election because of Facebook ads ?
O,"Yes , I do ."
O,"Well , but not because he , like , cheated , not because of Cambridge Analytica , but like , yes , I think he won because he ran an incredible ad campaign on Facebook ."
O,"Oh , so not because he was lying , but because he was ."
O,It was just like I think the lying probably helped .
O,Right .
O,"But like what Bosworth is saying is that , like , he was like they ran an incredible ad campaign ."
O,We're not going to do anything about politicians lying on our platform like .
O,Right .
O,We're not gonna do the thing that they do on the airwaves and they do everywhere else .
O,"Like where , you know , which is like you have to you can say things ."
O,We have to say the truth .
O,Right .
O,Got it .
O,"So it felt weird , like one day after that happened for this article to come out about like how great they are at securing the election ."
O,Okay .
O,And so it went up .
O,It went up immediately .
O,A lot of people were like this was a sponsored content isn't labeled as sponsor content .
O,It looks like an ad .
O,But you guys are acting like it's an article .
O,What's going on ?
O,"Also , the article didn't have a byline like there's no author attached to it ."
O,So what happened was it goes up Sheryl's Amberg from Facebook .
O,She posts about it .
O,"She's like , what a lovely article that was written about us ."
O,It's in Vogue .
O,I'm so happy with it .
O,"This New York Times reporter asked Facebook , like , what is the deal with this ?"
O,"And Facebook says something like , you know , this isn't sponsor content ."
O,It's a great article that happened here in about us .
O,The problem with Teen Vogue had already put up a thing saying that this was actually sponsored .
O,"Yeah , they like slapped a sponsored content tag on the article ."
O,Then how long after the article went up ?
O,Maybe a few hours .
O,Yeah .
O,O'Connors .
O,Then they took it off .
O,"Then I think they added a byline and took the byline off and the bylined person was like , I didn't write this ."
O,We you're talking about it .
O,My God .
O,"And then finally by the end of the day , like the article , they just took the article down ."
O,It was deleted .
O,Wow .
O,And so crazy .
O,"Oh , the other thing that happened was great is somebody tweeted at Teen Vogue was like , guys , what is this ?"
O,"And the Teen Vogue Twitter account tweeted back in this Twitter user , I say literally idk literally ."
O,I don't know .
O,I don't know .
O,I don't know what's going on .
O,Wow .
O,"So as the go the teen vogue , the Twitter presence of Teen Vogue was like , what the fuck is happening on Teen Vogue ?"
O,Exactly .
O,"And therefore , her editors were like whatever like advertising is done to editorial , like is messed up , like editorial ."
O,This great work .
O,This is horrible .
O,This is horrible .
O,This horrible bullying .
O,Nobody knew what had happened .
O,Okay .
O,So what happened was and this is according to Peter Kafka from Recode .
O,He had a source who given the story .
O,"What happened was , I guess like a year ago , Facebook had done sponsored some event for Teen Vogue and there is supposed to be sponsored content associate with that event , but then Facebook , it said , actually , we don't want you to do this because like usually groups people out like it doesn't persuade anybody ever ."
O,"It just like , why are you hijacking my news source ?"
O,"Similarly , forget it ."
O,But then somebody in the advertising side at Teen Vogue had the piece written anyway and they put it into their cims like that tool that publishes their articles on the Internet .
O,"And it just like you left it , there is a draft ."
O,"And then months later , by accident , apparently some is just like , oh , no , he published his article and they hit it and it's so bad ."
O,"Oh , no ."
O,Yeah .
O,So that's what these a Şaban .
O,What do you think of that ?
O,It feels dumb enough to be true to me .
O,I know .
O,"Anytime there's like a thing happens , it's like , okay , either this is an organized conspiracy or somebody hit the wrong button ."
O,I always believe that the wrong button thing .
O,I just .
O,Yeah .
O,That's been my experience of life on earth .
O,"Hitting the wrong button , hitting hard ."
O,"But yeah , people just make stupid mistakes and like this felt like a stupid thing ."
O,I do .
O,"Alex , you buy it as a person who's accidentally published an episode of our show ."
O,That was a test episode .
O,Redshift Failure in your village .
O,I was making was running a test on the cims .
O,And so I made a fake episode of the show called Friendship Village .
O,It was just a copy of another episode we already had published .
O,Thousands of people downloaded it .
O,Really ?
O,What the hell is Friendship Village ?
O,Right .
O,So I believe that presently run here .
O,But yeah .
O,Okay .
O,Human error .
O,Human error .
O,"So that's that's like the first half like a story of weird hamfisted screw ups that look like conspiracy , but are in fact not a conspiracy ."
O,Possibly .
O,We think maybe also what they do say is .
O,I'm pretty sure this tweet was posted .
O,"As you know , Teen Vogue was like in the mists of like a publishing and on publishing and messing with this article ."
O,Okay .
O,"Part 2 , part 2 is very enjoyable ."
O,Just to remind people the treat again reads the Teen Vogue article is going to come back as Troy Becker .
O,So we've we've established what the Teen Vogue article is .
O,"Yeah , 50 minutes and worth forwards into the tweet ."
O,"Trey Parker OK , so ."
O,GOLDMAN Have you ever used musically ?
O,You mean Tick-Tock ?
O,Yes .
O,"Yeah , but you never used it before ."
O,It was exac .
O,"I knew about it before it was Tick-Tock because there were like 13 year old influencers who basically were just like lip sync to a song and then they'd get like 15 comments and people being like , he's so beautiful ."
O,I can't believe it .
O,I love him so much .
O,What was the name of that ?
O,There's one in particular whose name I'm trying to remember who for like a second was like the hottest .
O,It's like the same name as every influencers like Sebastian Shaw .
O,So .
O,So just to make sure you understand this .
O,"A few years ago , there was this app that became very popular among young teenagers called musically ."
O,And the whole point of the app was just you take a video of yourself lip syncing to a song .
O,Mm hmm .
O,And that's it .
O,You don't sing the song .
O,It's just you just lip sync .
O,"Yeah , that makes sense to you ."
O,It doesn't make sense to me .
O,No .
O,It makes so much sense to me because .
O,So .
O,Okay .
O,Yes .
O,"How old I am , I am so old that I remember a time in the West before karaoke and I remember when karaoke first came to our show Shores ."
O,Really ?
O,I think karaoke was always with us .
O,I remember it too .
O,No .
O,And and I remember people explaining karaoke to me .
O,And I remember the explanation like .
O,Yeah .
O,"They played the song , but like the words are taken out ."
O,And so you sing the song .
O,"And I was like , oh , that person's got backwards ."
O,"Like , why would I want to hear myself singing the song ?"
O,"It must just be that you lip-sync the song because I would never want to hear myself seeing somebody else's song , but it would be fun to sort of lip-sync the song ."
O,"And so for a long time before I had done karaoke , I thought people were just like telling it to me wrong ."
O,And then I went to my first karaoke bar and then I saw people singing the words themselves .
O,Yeah .
O,"And I was like , so mad I leave ."
O,"I was like , why do I want to listen to , you know , this song ?"
O,And then I got really into it .
O,So I think it was really fun as a person who's done karaoke with you .
O,Can I just say how glad I am that it's not just lip singing because of your beautiful singing ?
O,Thank you .
O,Thank you .
O,OK .
O,"So musically comes out , it doesn't make sense to me ."
O,Makes a lot of sense to you .
O,"It's the thing that you thought karaoke was , but there should have ."
O,"Finally , it's real area ."
O,The karaoke .
O,We all wanted is here .
O,And there's this guy named Paul Zimmer .
O,"He's in his 20s who becomes kind of like instantly like a huge star on musically , like he amasses ."
O,He starts in 2015 .
O,"Within two years , he has seven million followers ."
O,"Oh , well , his videos are like very much like me to show you one ."
O,Okay .
O,OK .
O,"He's standing in front of like a blank white wall , like a bedroom or something like that ."
O,"He's like dancing at lip gang and doing sort of sexy moves , dancing back and forth ."
O,"He's got like these like frosted Frinton , frosted tips ."
O,He has a big quite the highest hair of anyone I've ever seen in my life .
O,Yeah .
O,Now he's like showing us abs .
O,"He does little shoulder shimmy , accusing a cute boy who works at the mall and comes here , in my opinion ."
O,"Also , he doesn't have a lot of moves ."
O,It's like he chooses her .
O,He's string .
O,He puts his hand to his mouth like he's singing and he touches his hair .
O,And at times he kind of like mimes the words a little bit .
O,And that's it .
O,That's all .
O,It's all in the same bedroom .
O,"OK , so that that is Paul Zimmer ."
O,That is what people got really excited about .
O,They got a baby .
O,People got excited about that .
O,That kid .
O,That kid .
O,Yes .
O,Wait .
O,"Actually , sorry ."
O,Seven million people .
O,That's wild .
O,That is that's so interesting .
O,That's sort of like that is like .
O,It's like literally it's a vehicle for eighth grade popularity to go viral .
O,Yes .
O,"Nothing , I'm just feeling my bubbling resentment for popular kids in eighth grade coming back ."
O,You were just back in eighth grade .
O,I did .
O,I've always been I've always been like this and they've always been like that .
O,And I'll never forgive them for it .
O,"So he becomes like you done musically , musically , actually got bought , renamed to Tick-Tock ."
O,So then he became immediately like as soon as Tate hyphen .
O,She was like one of the biggest people on Tick-Tock .
O,He had a big Instagram channel .
O,He had a big YouTube channel .
O,And how old is he ?
O,He's 24 now .
O,He looks younger .
O,Right .
O,He looks a lot younger .
O,"Oh , interesting , okay ."
O,So isn't the answer surprised me about Paul Zimmer ?
O,"Because he's like he comes across as like literally just a pretty face , like he doesn't even have like a lot of personality , but apparently does his comedy videos ."
O,"They're really bad , though ."
O,So like this is from the clip is actually from another .
O,"You were making fun of him , but it's Paul Zimmer ."
O,"The clip starts with him , just like talking on the phone to a friend of his ."
O,Walking through what looks like a school that just hasn't been .
O,Seriously ?
O,So .
O,"The video was him saying on the phone , I just had some beans and then a fart sound ."
O,"Yeah , there's a fart sound of some passer Vagos ."
O,Seriously ?
O,And that's the whole video .
O,"You know , in addition to always having resented popular people , I've always found farts very funny ."
O,So I was totally fine .
O,"Otherwise , what are you back with that ?"
O,"Basically , you know , Paul Zimmer , you're right ."
O,They were not that different after all .
O,You have in his vast amount of beautiful popular about Alex .
O,"My theory about him up to this point is he's just like one of those people who is very good looking , who kind of maybe on one hand understands they're very good looking ."
O,He's like he's taking videos of his face every day .
O,But in another way is like does understand it .
O,"Like some of the privileges and ease of life that he's accrued has to do with his face , like he poses like completely unfunny economy videos ."
O,"But they get tons of views because people like comments in their polls , everything , whatever ."
O,Right .
O,Got it .
O,"So in twenty , twenty , sixteen musically had launched this other app called Lively where because the problem with having like 7 million followers on musically is there's no way to make money off of that really ."
O,Okay .
O,"But Lively came out and it was like you had your fans could buy these stickers for money , they could give you the stickers ."
O,Then you got proceeds from money as a way to like hit up your fans .
O,And Paul Zimmer started just charging people for whatever you could think of .
O,"You was like , if you send me stickers , I'll like , share your videos ."
O,I'll send you a I'm just like any micro social interaction on the Internet .
O,"Here , Monitise ."
O,Right .
O,The problem is .
O,"When people paid him to do those things , those people said that oftentimes he would just not do them like hundreds of people were saying this as his fans are getting very angry ."
O,"There's like this whole like band Paul Zimmer movement , like he kind of like couldn't say anything without being screamed at by like a horde of disappointed teenage girls ."
O,Got it .
O,"So like any reasonable adult , he did the only thing that made sense , which is to completely flee the Internet and completely never to be heard from again ."
O,Really ?
O,Yeah .
O,So he's gone .
O,He's gone .
O,Did apologize .
O,Just like left .
O,Wow .
O,Yes .
O,That's actually sort of an unusual ending to that story .
O,More unusual things will happen .
O,So when was this ?
O,"This was twenty , seventeen , twenty separate , twenty , seventeen ."
O,So like he is like a 21st century flimflam man who's like basically breezed into town .
O,"So he's a snake oil sort of people , his like voter shares and diapers and then picked up his steaks and moved on ."
O,Yeah .
O,Moved on .
O,Okay .
O,And then two years later .
O,He makes another post .
O,Okay .
O,"On Instagram , I find this part very dry ."
O,"Well , so ."
O,So October twenty nineteen he says .
O,He post a picture of himself and a picture of this actor .
O,Mm hmm .
O,And the whole pose is just like doesn't sector can look like .
O,"Like he says , like he says , like , hey , this actor tribe at Tribeca , A-G , kid , literally looks like a younger , sexier version of me ."
O,Crying smiley face emoji .
O,I don't even use social media anymore but had to post this haha he posted side by side of them .
O,This is Paul .
O,"This is the guy , Trey ."
O,They're the same person .
O,They're exactly the same .
O,"I mean , he tried to make it look as different as possible because of the quote unquote Paul photo is sort of like dimly lit ."
O,And it's very like it's a very candid photo .
O,It's just like a cell phone .
O,And he's like he's got like a lot of stubble and he's like sort of like not as politique polished .
O,"And then the Troy photo , quote unquote , tri-faith is like very it's like a headshot ."
O,It's got glam .
O,It's got that sort of like spherical gray thing that they do in the background of like school photos .
O,And it's like he's definitely got makeup on and like but they're not had a strong enough effect on Sunday .
O,"And yes , I in the next nobody be like , did you get a haircut ?"
O,"Yeah , it's not different ."
O,Up for the .
O,Did you get Erica .
O,Exactly .
O,Because they didn't have the same Erica .
O,"And then he makes another post or he says , hey , it's Paul Zimmer ."
O,This is probably going to be my last social post ever .
O,I just come to replace my life for being in the spotlight .
O,"And being entertainer is no in my passion , although it deeply saddens me to leave so bluntly , especially that so many of you have watched me for so many years ."
O,I didn't want my social media pages just sitting to die .
O,So I've decided to give my social media accounts to try Bekker .
O,I don't know why you guys a lot of subtle .
O,This was in October .
O,"Yeah , because he's one of the Dobis people I know ."
O,"And he's literally my younger twin , my much younger twin ."
O,I believe Troy's fifteen or sixteen years old .
O,Ha ha ha .
O,So this is a 24 year old man training of his people .
O,He's a 16 year old boy .
O,There is a certain kind of like .
O,"There's a certain kind of Internet scam where , like , it's so brazen that , like , I really , really there isn't ."
O,I feel like there was this heavy metal musician who was like doing a solo tour across Europe .
O,And basically I feel like I made a bunch of fake accounts and like made up a fake agent .
O,There was like this very you convince people that he was in a real band ?
O,"Yeah , it had tons of listeners ."
O,And then he would show up at these dates and had like a face like a fake like fanny councillor's stuff .
O,And he would get himself booked a new job at venues and nobody would show up because his band didn't actually have any fans .
O,"Like it was just him and some musicians we'd hired who didn't realize , like what he was actually up to ."
O,Right .
O,It is that level of audacity .
O,Like it just there's some people who really shoot the moon .
O,"They're just like , you know what ?"
O,I'm going to figure it out when I get there .
O,"And like , that's what this guy do ."
O,"You guys want to meet Troy Becker , your interaction video ."
O,Yes .
O,"Hey , what's up ?"
O,My name's Troy Becker .
O,I'm an actor .
O,"Cause him I reached out to me and asked to record a video because he says he really , really looks like me ."
O,And he wanted to post it onto something called Tick-Tock .
O,So please wait .
O,He's 15 or 16 .
O,Yeah .
O,It's October of twenty nineteen .
O,And he doesn't know what Tick-Tock is .
O,He doesn't know .
O,He knows .
O,There's also a lot because where it'll be like it'll be like Paulsboro .
O,So he really looks like .
O,"But I don't , I don't really see it ."
O,I .
O,Wow .
O,So everyone notices .
O,Like everyone else .
O,"Yeah , yeah ."
O,We're a very visual species .
O,I love that he made the plot problem of every of everything from like Shakespeare to Superman to Three's Company .
O,"The fact that you that you can easily disguise yourself , we didn't really do ."
O,You can't do .
O,He took that problem and made it his likes .
O,That was his plan .
O,Yes .
O,"The other one is they are the scam is that I kind of fell for a version of this like in my lifetime , which is when I was like a kid ."
O,"I think extremely , extremely gullible child making like really , really the most like what I am at camp ."
O,A bunch of kids sobbing .
O,There's a rumor going around that I wear diapers to camp and I could distribute as I pull my pants in front of everybody .
O,I'm super simple as I .
O,"Yes , you to pay that ."
O,But what I was like 10 .
O,"My my aunt , my cousin moved to Philly and they like stayed with us for a while with their get on their feet and my cousin just like loves to tell me elaborate lies because I believed every single one of them ."
O,Right .
O,"And one day he came downstairs and was like , hey , how's it going ?"
O,"And I said to him , he's like , that's my name ."
O,"I was like , What ?"
O,Why ?
O,"He's like , my name's Jack the Bulldog ."
O,"And he told me that he was a man named Jack the Bulldog who looked exactly my cousin , but it flushed my cousin down the drain and only difference to my cousin ."
O,And Jack was that Jack talked to artificially gravelly voice and he wore sunglasses all the time .
O,"And I was like , but those are my sunglasses ."
O,"You really would have benefited from having an older sibling , but you were like ."
O,But I guess it's true .
O,I guess it's true .
O,"You know , I totally thought I thought that a murderer lived in my house and then I couldn't tell anybody ."
O,How old ?
O,How old are you ?
O,Ten .
O,"Oh , my two ."
O,That is so funny .
O,But you know what ?
O,"My son , who's nine and a half , would totally be the same way ."
O,Like Ellia .
O,I think there's something about him .
O,It's funny because I think you've overcompensated and now you're like shifty and skeptical .
O,But probably there's something about Leg. when you're young and you and you have no instinct towards guile at all .
O,Like my son .
O,It's baffling .
O,Like why anybody would ever do that .
O,Yeah .
O,And I wonder if you were that kind of kid .
O,"Also , it's just like if you love stories , you'll believe bullshit stories for a long time ."
O,And then .
O,Huh ?
O,"When you realize you'll make up bullshit surge of like , oh well that seems fun too ."
O,Yeah .
O,I convinced my next door neighbor that there was a boy living in the walls of her house .
O,So really when I was a kid I was probably couldn't have been older than nine because I moved when I was nine .
O,But I think the only two kinds of kids are liars .
O,And jump .
O,No .
O,"Yeah , totally ."
O,I get divorce Zimmer .
O,"So basically , as soon as he posted that second , quote unquote , Troy Becker post , everybody just started making fun of Mike ."
O,"So , OK , so so okay ."
O,"So , so , so pieces that go unnoticed are the uncanny resemblance ."
O,"Every single time he tries to post anything as Trey , all these fans show up just like thousands of comments , every single comment either being like , dude , somebody was like , what was it like ?"
O,You are you're like the CEO pretending to be somebody else ?
O,Or the other thing they'll do is they'll be like they'll just quote back .
O,Paul Zimmer lines for the big man tree .
O,"You really look a lot like Paul Zimmer , like a younger , sexier suit , like do you work remotely ?"
O,And I don't know how it's supposed to work in his head .
O,"Like , I don't know what ."
O,I don't know what the plan even was .
O,"Oh , I thought the plan was like I will just be able to carry on ."
O,He wanted collecting money from the Internet .
O,"He writes , I'm new process ."
O,He wanted to do Whitman Don Draper scenario where he was going to take over that his life .
O,And just like he would have all of that person to accolades and needs and desires and be able to exploit their platform to get more money .
O,Right .
O,He no longer has the baggage .
O,It's a rebrand is it no longer has the baggage of having not fulfilled all of those things that he got paid for .
O,"Companies get to do it all the time , like , hey , we're not cigarette that company anymore ."
O,We're fresh air company cigarettes .
O,We're not Blackwater .
O,"We're X E , right ."
O,There was G.E. Financial that became Ally Bank .
O,I thought Bank was a new bank .
O,No bank was a that was the rebrand .
O,They did a good job .
O,They were one of the most bailed out banks of the of the financial crisis .
O,Really ?
O,Ally Bank is .
O,"No , it sounds a friendly way ."
O,"Your allies , like one kind of idiot would fall for this thing ."
O,But also the re-brand is like a wonder .
O,"I was like , I've never ."
O,"Rosebank , why do they buy so much advertising on NPR ?"
O,"Yes , exac also the rebrands , like visually , it's like purple ."
O,It's got like this sort of like modernly look to it .
O,It's really not a younger version .
O,"They're like a younger , sexier version of financial ."
O,Now as G .
O,Wait no .
O,And take it is a G G M .
O,Yeah .
O,"Ally Bank was like the GMAC , which was the financial arm of GM ."
O,General Motors .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,So in Troy beggers case he was I think he was just trying to like just smile through all this .
O,And then this journalist for the New Statesman wrote like a huge piece as a reason I know about this .
O,"And after that , he shut down everything like Troy Becker seems to have disappeared as thoroughly as Paul Zimmer did before him ."
O,Got it .
O,"I mean , Tribe had until Troy Becker notices that there is a musician who looks like he was a little bit younger and sexier and his eyes are the goodness of his heart ."
O,Dan Ever's accounts .
O,That's amazing .
O,"al-Islamiya , do you want to try to go back and explain history to us ?"
O,"Yes , I do ."
O,"OK , so this tweet ."
O,The tweet again .
O,Dave Jorgensen tweeted this .
O,The Teen Vogue article .
O,He's gonna come back as Troy Becker .
O,OK .
O,"So the idea is basically there was an article posted on Teen Vogue that looks suspiciously like sponsored content , they took it down and it was caused a little bit of a brouhaha ."
O,That's the Teen Vogue part .
O,And then there is this .
O,"The Troy part is there was this Tick-Tock Star named Paul Zimmer , who made a bunch promises that he didn't deliver on his fans , got really , really mad at him ."
O,"He disappeared , then came back months later , years later , years later , you're here years later ."
O,It took him years to hatched this plan .
O,Anyway .
O,"And then it came back years later saying like , I found this guy who looks a lot like makes up ."
O,He's just younger and handsomer and he's gonna take over my account .
O,See you guys later .
O,And then then the new guy was named Troy Becker .
O,The new guy Haircuts .
O,New guy was named Troy Becker .
O,"And then he looked exactly like the old guy , Paul Zimmer ."
O,"And everybody on the Internet noticed and and was like , you're the same person ."
O,Yes .
O,"Ah , yes , yes , yes ."
O,"Yes , I understand ."
O,I also understand 100 percent .
O,All right .
O,I think .
O,Right .
O,Yes .
O,"Yes , yes ."
O,Coming up after the break .
O,"Yes , it's now ."

O,"Alex , you have another tweet for us ."
O,I do have another tweet .
O,It's from a Twitter user named John Cardillo .
O,And the tweet goes like this .
O,Hashtag moves like Bloomberg Gate whistleblower at Nick cheerily deserves our support .
O,Parentheses best controversy I've seen in a while .
O,And parentheses .
O,Hashtag moves like Bloomberg .
O,"Hashtag drop out , Bloomberg ."
O,Do you feel implicated by this ?
O,Two different spelling of Bloomberg .
O,I think it's got a bunch of RYTARY .
O,It's a bunch of legs .
O,"And I'm you know , I don't know what's going on here ."
O,So PJ Vogt changed in the street .
O,I do .
O,"Alex Bloomberg , do understand the street ?"
O,No .
O,I was on .
O,Do you understand me ?
O,I do .
O,All right .
O,We're back .
O,Was supposed to be OK .
O,"I think it starts with P , but adjudge , right ?"
O,Yeah .
O,"Well , yeah ."
O,Do you know about the mayor ?
O,"Pete , dance the mayor ."
O,"Pete , dance ."
O,Yeah .
O,You know about Pete .
O,Bhuta Judge Ray .
O,I know Pete .
O,The Mayor .
O,Mayor Pete .
O,I did not know he had a dance though .
O,"Oh , he does ."
O,"Oh , okay ."
O,Right .
O,And I do it .
O,It's like it's like this .
O,"Wait , can you put on the song Hi-Ho ."
O,Yeah .
O,Okay .
O,So the desert's the better get the disco song .
O,Hi oves .
O,Which I'd never heard before .
O,The Mayor paedo .
O,Yeah I know .
O,I know this because my kids like it .
O,Well I have high hopes for them .
O,So just so you know like this is a thing that the mayor Pete campaign thought would be like a great motivator for Mayor Pete .
O,Campaign volunteers .
O,Yeah .
O,"Like when they're like out in the field , they're feeling bored or like need to get like fired up before a meeting ."
O,Like they play this song and they do the dance .
O,"Alex is about to do for you know , I do dance fully ."
O,"Oh , I've watched the videos of this show ."
O,Many ways to take a line dance .
O,It's like it's like a ladder thing .
O,It's a dance that's simple enough that you can pick it up .
O,I would call it a SUBJ Macarena .
O,Macarena .
O,Okay .
O,Okay .
O,Okay .
O,Okay .
O,I've got a panic at the disco .
O,"Can I just preface by saying that like my mom , her entire life has done a dance that is specifically designed to embarrass me in public ."
O,And it is remarkably close to Mayor Dance .
O,Okay .
O,You're gonna do it .
O,Bloomberg can describe what's happening .
O,All right .
O,All right .
O,"In one , two , three ."
O,Showtime .
O,"So it's just like , oh , my ."
O,"So it's just like it's just like in a quarter , the hands move in the four quadrants ."
O,Hi .
O,Hi .
O,Lo lo .
O,"And they do sometimes they point , sometimes they do the like ."
O,We're moving wheely motion .
O,Sometimes they clap .
O,It's just like you're just gonna push your .
O,Hi .
O,Hi .
O,Hi .
O,Hi .
O,"Down , down , down , down , up , right up ."
O,Right .
O,Like YMCA a little bit .
O,It's like y._m._c._a .
O,Yeah .
O,There are videos of of Mayor Pete Fowler .
O,Here's a great big line .
O,"Jay , check rebuildable ."
O,Do it .
O,Hold on .
O,This is them .
O,This is I'm doing it at lunchbreak at the hashtag Pete Summit .
O,And just like a drab hotel conference room .
O,"Oh , my God ."
O,"Oh , my God , everybody ."
O,"It's like literally like just like a picture of the drab EST conference room with like this chairs and the pope , the raised podium and leg ."
O,Lanyards and all the people sitting there .
O,And then all of a sudden they're standing up and doing this dance .
O,It looks like an ass .
O,Why does it looks really creepy ?
O,It looks like when I took Calvin did the best one game and they said that the cheerleaders come out into their routines .
O,"He was looking at and he was just like , daddy ."
O,It's pleasing to the eye to see people doing the same thing all at the same time .
O,"I was like , yeah , you nailed that ."
O,But it is pleasing in some situations .
O,But then it's also creepy in some situations .
O,"And so like that and like North Korea and political rallies , it's like really creepy ."
O,"You see people doing the same , people doing the same thing in unison ."
O,It feels like forced fun .
O,Yeah .
O,I wonder what the political calculus of that kind of thing is .
O,It feels to me a little bit like there's so much grassroots support to this that everybody knows that they can spontaneously break out into it into a choreographed dance .
O,"I was listening pod's in America and they were talking about it and they were like , it was funny because I think they're trying not to side with any of the Democratic candidates in the primary season ."
O,"They're like , we're not trying ."
O,Is anything bad about me ?
O,Repeat .
O,The dance is really nerdy .
O,"And then one day it was like , well , if you've ever , like , doorknocked or like , done grassroots stuff , it's just really , really boring and soul sucking ."
O,"It's like anything you can do to just like , here's the fun thing we do ."
O,Like you're just consciously trying to make people more energetic .
O,"And Sukhi side is just like that , that it's not it's not for Twitter ."
O,"You know , they're putting it on Twitter , but it's like just like a rah rah rah ."
O,Let's go get them .
O,"I don't know , man ."
O,"If I were doing that , I just wouldn't let it end up on the Internet ."
O,But I also like I'm coming across snarkier about this .
O,And I want to actually .
O,"Because , like , I'm glad that there's people dancing that conversation ."
O,Yeah .
O,So but people made fun of this .
O,"And I think also part the reason people made fun of this is like Mayor P , he he doesn't do well on Twitter , like the world of Twitter ."
O,At least the Twitter that I see is like conservatives who obviously aren't going like a Democratic presidential candidate .
O,"But then people , if they're on the left , they shouldn't be like far on the left right ."
O,And he's kind of seen as like individually progressive and .
O,"Seer and dweeby Ray entered the dweeby dance kind of plays into that , right ?"
O,"And so people were like , there are lots of videos of people just doing the dance , but they were like they were pretending that they thought it was cool , but they didn't think it was cool ."
O,Right .
O,There is a lot of people doing the dances like different songs .
O,"And it's just sort of funny under any song , but it works under almost any song ."
O,But it was it was like a cycle .
O,It was like I think they started posting the dancing in September and like it felt like September through the winter .
O,There was a lot of making fun of this .
O,Okay .
O,And then Michael Bloomberg enters the presidential race .
O,"No relation , no relation ."
O,Different spelling .
O,"And he is kind of disliked , actually , in a similar way to me ."
O,"Repeat , unlike progressive Twitter ."
O,"You know , he's a billionaire ."
O,"He was really into sobhan , frankly ."
O,It's like this is not this is not who a lot of people want .
O,"So this is meeting next rally pose the following tweet , a tweet that has two thousand seven hundred forty one retweets ."
O,Look out .
O,Hashtag team Pete .
O,Because us Bloomberg heads have our own dance taken at the Mike Bloomberg rally in Beverly Hills .
O,Hashtag Bloomberg 20:20 hashtag moves like Bloomberg .
O,"One important thing to note for you see this video is that at the time you made a tweet , he had changed his Twitter avatar to look like a young political aide ."
O,And she just Twitter bio to say they worked for the Bloomberg .
O,Hmm .
O,So I tweeted this out .
O,Okay .
O,You ready ?
O,Yeah .
O,You want to her using a hose like it looks like it looks like sort of like a studio audience .
O,"Like when they like pan the camera and you're looking at it , it's like a bunch of people and sort of a narrower , darker room ."
O,It's not like a conference room area .
O,"Their on bleachers , grand bleachers like , yeah , they're on bleachers in a smaller room ."
O,There's a whole bunch of them and they're like the songs playing and the first move and it's like the same thing .
O,It's like move to the right .
O,Move to the left .
O,Down low .
O,Down low .
O,Up high .
O,Up high .
O,Same sort of like it's the same sort of thing .
O,Except they said what they're doing is they're like sort of like doing this finger-wagging thing with disco points .
O,"It's like a disco point , but it also seems like a shame , shame , shame , shame ."
O,With this finger is just like you and you and you and you and you and a sort of a finger-wagging way .
O,Yeah .
O,And then at the end they do their thing where you pretend to go underwater .
O,"Can I just can I just say that when I first saw this , I was completely taken in ."
O,"And I went into the group chat and I mean , it was like , guys , you will not believe this and posted it ."
O,"And they were like , yeah , but it's a joke ."
O,"And I was like , oh , I'm an idiot ."
O,I would .
O,The only reason involved or it honestly is because the place where they recorded it is outrageous .
O,"Brigade , L.A. Theater ."
O,And I've been there .
O,"Ray , I just recognize the room ."
O,It was fully on that uncanny valley satire line .
O,"The other thing that sort of makes it convincing is that the demographics of the people at this comedy show , which are like young , pretty male , pretty white , looks like how you would imagine people working the Bloomberg campaign ."
O,"But everybody everybody everybody fell for it like , oh , really ?"
O,Everybody fell for it like guy .
O,"Besides , household men are just like all these journalists and writers who work on the Internet and are good at reading the Internet like geat here ."
O,Hunter Walker just had a quote .
O,Bloomberg heads because they were for themselves .
O,Bloomberg heads in Beverly Hills .
O,"Even Maggie Haberman tweeted she put a question mark on it , but she tweeted it ."
O,Huh .
O,It's just like everybody why they fell for everybody over .
O,But so the next thing that happened .
O,"Okay , Team Bloomberg campaign has to do something ."
O,Yes .
O,And they try to do something .
O,And like a good spirited we're not mad way .
O,So they tweet to clarify at nixa Rally is not an intern for our campaign .
O,And he does not have moves like Bloomberg .
O,"Nick , apply to work for us here ."
O,And then there's a link to where you work for the campaign .
O,Got it .
O,Fine .
O,And then Nick does all Nick does an incredible just like a tiny bit of world building .
O,Yes .
O,You remember that so much better .
O,"I don't , he says ."
O,"Wait , are you firing me ?"
O,"Oh , yeah ."
O,"So then Nick tweets , As a creator of hashtag moves like Bloomberg , I disavow it ."
O,And the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign read the truth about the dance here .
O,Hashtag drop-out Bloomberg .
O,"And then there's a tweet where he says , I plenty more to share , but what people are saying is true ."
O,The moves like Bloomberg dances orchestrated and drive by Bloomberg .
O,And then he has a note like a fake email that says Budget to pay dancing actors .
O,"Hey , Nick , I've just received approval from on high for you to hire 50 to 60 actors to pose as supporters during the moves like Bloomberg Dancing choreographed ."
O,We want to create the impression that enthusiastic young people are excited about Mike .
O,They came up with the infectious dance spontaneously .
O,We've walked out eight hours to rehearse with actors next week and we can allot $20 an actor .
O,They must all sign .
O,NDA is also unrelated .
O,We are discontinuing your gas stipend .
O,Part of the all round crunch that's been happening .
O,"Brad Evans , social media coordinator , Bloomberg ."
O,"OK , so like I think at this point , like most journalists realize they controlled except for the right , like Bright Bart writes a story about their like the Bloomberg campaign made the super embarrassing video and then they fired the guy who made it ."
O,"My God , there's certain causes like alright Internet that love the idea that they like ."
O,"Often whenever there's signs of like progressive grassroots support , they're like they're paid their crisis actors , whatever ."
O,And it's just like so served right at their existing beliefs .
O,So CBB Goroka tweets apparently not a parody .
O,Donald Trump junior favorites the tweet with the like crisis. act or email on it .
O,"So , OK , so that's the fall ."
O,That's like the all troll of it .
O,OK .
O,"John Cardillo , who did the tweet ."
O,"He's he's sort of like a fixture on conservative , unlike ."
O,"Alright , Internet ."
O,He's just used to being NYPD .
O,"She talks like constantly and he's kind of famous for is in response to this , like protests in the city ."
O,"He posted a picture himself on Twitter pointing a gun at the camera , essentially threatening any protesters who came near him ."
O,Got it .
O,OK .
O,Charmer .
O,"He was one of the , I think , early wave ."
O,People like get the point .
O,He's tweeting about this .
O,He believes that the Bloomberg team has fired their crisis actors and their crisis actors are falling .
O,So the John Cardillo tweet is he's in the midst of this is during the action .
O,And he believes that the moves like Bloomberg thing is real .
O,Yes .
O,And that's the drop out Bloomberg thing is right .
O,"I mean , it's like what would be more fun than somebody you politically disagree with being so unpopular that they hired actors to pretend to support them ."
O,But then we're so cheap that they didn't pay the actors enough .
O,And the thing backfires .
O,And the actors are like going public because they don't care about 20 bucks an hour and telling everybody what happened .
O,Right .
O,It's like a very enjoyable fiction .
O,That would be .
O,Yes .
O,"Yes , that would be ."
