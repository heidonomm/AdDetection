O,"So I am standing outside of the Safeway supermarket in Erie , Colorado ."
O,And it is toilet paper day .
O,There are three people standing out here in the cold .
O,"Around 6:30 in the morning , I'm going to go talk to them ."
O,Hello .
O,How are you guys ?
O,Thanks .
O,After the battle my whole life .
O,"Sixty three and a half years , I'd be throwing my flight out of bed at 5:30 looking for foil ."
O,"And did you have the intel that this place got its toilet paper shoved under your Saturday and one nice young lady , when Marty asked about toilet paper , said , our truck is coming Monday , we'll be open ."
O,"7:00 a.m. and I said , honey , yes , were caught them haha ."
O,"I've been rationing two squares a trip for a couple of weeks and you're looking at a calculator on Facebook that I had three days worth and I'm like , No , this doesn't work for me ."
O,Out from The New York Times .
O,"Unlike Obama , this is The Daily today ."
O,How are you feeling physically right now ?
O,Are people trying at all to stay away from one another ?
O,Or is that not even possible ?
O,As much of America enters its second month of lockdown to contain the Corona virus .
O,Are there other patients that are there today that you are thinking about today ?
O,Is there something about them that really sticks in your mind ?
O,"I think my colleagues speak to people in Pittsburgh , Kansas City , New York and Seattle about their new realities ."
O,"It's Monday , April 13th ."
O,"Oh , hi , Campbell ."
O,"Well , I'm sorry , did you say did you ask me a question ?"
O,"You're saying , how are you doing ?"
O,"You know , today was up and down ."
O,Take me around .
O,"And as we're gone , you can tell me about your day so far ."
O,Let me see .
O,Is there a way to slip ?
O,I'm Campbell Robertson .
O,I'm a national correspondent based in Pittsburgh .
O,I spoke with a neighbor of my turning down to show me where people were stationed at the moment .
O,"Oh , well , all the kids are watching TV in the basement ."
O,And I can't really .
O,"I don't really want to deal with them right now because they're just , you know , there's them ."
O,"I mean , she works in public law and she's been working at home for the last few weeks ."
O,Her husband works at a hospital here .
O,So she's basically been a lone caregiver for their three boys .
O,"They're two , five and eight years old ."
O,I don't know .
O,What else do you want to say ?
O,So tell me about today .
O,How is it gone today ?
O,"Today , you horse ."
O,It was it was a calm .
O,"It was a relatively calm morning , actually , kind of quiet morning , and then they age and yeah ."
O,"Yeah , I had yeah ."
O,Do some homework .
O,I had the other to just watch TV .
O,So I do some homework .
O,OK .
O,"I tried to get some work done mid-morning , which I did ."
O,I finished one project .
O,So it was fine .
O,And then .
O,My oldest one had like one major tantrum or he was just screaming because he couldn't find his sweatshirt .
O,It's like his favorite sweatshirt .
O,It turned out it was on one of the strollers outside .
O,Why would you leave it in the stroller like it's yours ?
O,What's your .
O,You're responsible for it .
O,Did he school work today ?
O,Eight year old ?
O,Yeah .
O,So we're on Google Classroom .
O,I show you .
O,They post class work here .
O,This is math reading .
O,Creative writing .
O,"And then apparently they were supposed to play the Oregon Trail game , but I wasn't able to get it to work ."
O,"But at one point during his homework , he had a big mug of milk and he spilled it all over the table ."
O,That was a lot of jfc from me .
O,There were some tantrums over division .
O,"He's doing division now and , you know , he's still trying to grok the concept ."
O,I think he's pretty much familiar with multiplication .
O,"I don't know how good he is at it , but he's been able to do it without a lot of tears ."
O,Division is still tears .
O,It's divisive .
O,It's divisive .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,He seems like a chill guy usually .
O,"I mean , am I now ?"
O,So how how how are the three and five year old today ?
O,They were good .
O,They were .
O,Hey .
O,Yes .
O,Right .
O,The other two I have been just generally letting them float along and whatever they want to do .
O,But occasionally they'll get sick of the TV and they'll just come upstairs and do something non TV related .
O,And it's like it's like good and bad .
O,"It's like , oh , that's nice ."
O,You're using your imagination .
O,"But on the other hand , it's like , please just go watch TV and don't destroy the house ."
O,"So the little one just likes to kind of run laps around the house , which is great because that , you know , kind of wears model of it or ."
O,Hold on a second .
O,"Yeah , but I think ."
O,What .
O,What's wrong ?
O,What do you want .
O,Milk .
O,You want milk ?
O,Yeah .
O,Milk .
O,Sorry .
O,You wanna say hi to Campbell ?
O,Hi .
O,How are you ?
O,You having fun ?
O,You're a baby .
O,He's barely .
O,He's a baby again .
O,Yeah .
O,We'll get there eventually .
O,I think generally we're settling into our routines .
O,"I mean , that first two weeks with Ross , but it's just having a hard time accepting that ."
O,"Oh , my God ."
O,All my kids are gonna be home all the time and I'm going to be pretty much by myself with them the entire time .
O,"And oh , my God , how am I going to handle this ?"
O,Because I haven't had to do this and I've never been this .
O,Now they're used to being at home .
O,"They're used to like this , whatever this is ."
O,So there's not really a choice at this point .
O,"You know , we're all condemned to be with each other , basically ."
O,Listen .
O,Thank you .
O,Tanning .
O,All right .
O,Yeah .
O,You .
O,Donna .
O,"Hey , John ."
O,But The New York Times .
O,How you doing ?
O,I'll do well .
O,"I guess we should probably keep our distance , right ."
O,OK .
O,"I'm John Ilegal , reporter based in Kansas City ."
O,How are you doing ?
O,I was today for you and it was good .
O,It was actually good .
O,"I slept all day now , all day , but I slept late in a few weeks ago , I spoke with Donna Dennehy ."
O,"Sleeping sometimes is a good thing , right ?"
O,Yeah .
O,I needed it .
O,And I lost her job when the economy slowed down in the wake of the virus .
O,"So I guess , you know , take me back to the beginning ."
O,Just tell me how you got in this position that you .
O,I was working and shake and shake .
O,I have been working there for nine months .
O,"In a couple weeks ago , they told us at midnight that night they were shutting down except for the drive through ."
O,"And my friend , which I was staying with , she went to stay with her boyfriend , which moved to Iowa and she was gonna go anyway , but she just lost her job , so she just went ahead and win ."
O,And that put me in my car .
O,It's my cat .
O,And so how long are you staying in a car ?
O,"Fourth to expand two weeks today , I think ."
O,And what was that like being in the car ?
O,"It was rainy , it was cold ."
O,"Some some nice wasn't so bad that the worst thing was going to the bathroom because in the beginning , you know , I could walk into like Wal-Mart ."
O,Go to the bathroom at the gas station .
O,"I started flying a couple of times , I parked there and I I I don't even know they're still offering shares , but I could pay to take a shower for $12 ."
O,So you were going to truckstop the shower ?
O,Yeah .
O,And also a stay there .
O,"But like today , most of the bathrooms are closed ."
O,There's just no place to go .
O,"And sometimes when I want to sleep , I just wanted to stay asleep because I didn't know what to do with myself ."
O,"I don't know , just just it was just scary , a lot of things ran through my head ."
O,I call for resources and talk to this lady .
O,"She said , well , maybe we can put you in a hotel for a day or so ."
O,And I was happy with that .
O,She called me back and she told me that they had me a room .
O,And I came in and I checked in .
O,They gave me the rules and been here ever since .
O,And it's it's awesome .
O,It's .
O,Great to have a place to go .
O,No .
O,"In my cat , my cat , just like you should've seen it when she went it through ."
O,"She was like , haven't I ?"
O,"I buy her a little treats , I buy a little toys just because , you know , she wants your help too ."
O,And nobody can take care of me .
O,And I'm not doing a very good job .
O,"No , no , I ."
O,I leave here Friday .
O,I don't know what's going to happen .
O,And I'm going to be .
O,"That out there , again , is having a hard time ."
O,"You know , I'm having a hard time with it ."
O,"Last week , I found a job ."
O,"My friend , she worked for Konstantinos for years ."
O,Supermarket .
O,"And so meet her , we're down there together and spoke with him and we had to go back a couple of days later because we had talked to corporate ."
O,It took me forever to get ready .
O,"It's hard to do in the car , especially when it's raining , when you're closing your trunk , getting ready and dressed in the backseat , washing your hair out of a milk jug ."
O,"You know , water jug , brushing your teeth ."
O,Trying to find something to wear out the trunk of my car .
O,"But , you know , I don't know where with our certificate is or my Social Security card ."
O,And I thought that I could use my passport .
O,"My passport expired , so she couldn't accept that ."
O,But it's just pinning my birth certificate .
O,You and my friend that got me the job .
O,She's worked like seven days straight right now .
O,And so I just see her go to work every day of the day .
O,I want to go .
O,I wanted to .

O,I'm Alan Foya .
O,I'm a reporter for The New York Times Metro Desk .
O,"A couple of weeks ago , I had spoken to an inmate named Foster Thompson ."
O,Foster is a 55 year old New Yorker who was arrested and sent to prison for a murder on Staten Island in nineteen ninety two .
O,He's been in the state prison system ever since .
O,"And recently he's been at singsing for the last three years where there have been , according to state officials , at least two cases of the Corona virus in the prison population ."
O,"So anyhow , we're expecting a call from Foster in the next few minutes ."
O,And he's gonna tell us about conditions in Sing-Sing right now .
O,"Hello , can you hear me , Foster ?"
O,Yes .
O,Yep .
O,Here you go .
O,Great .
O,So it's it's Monday morning and I just wonder if you could describe for me where you are now and what's around you .
O,"Well , right now , I'm in a little like phone book role in the fourth floor of building eight ."
O,Got it .
O,"Now , how long have you been in the state prison system ?"
O,"Since the night before , haven't these last couple of weeks compared to other , you know , crisis times in your time in prison ."
O,People was more panic than it was Yemen last night .
O,"In a few words this morning , you failed that test in the body , but it's grown up ."
O,"You know , they told you about us , but yet last night you had at least it sounded like from four different areas , you know , coughing and sneezing all night , you know , literally all night ."
O,"You know , like I got asthma , you know , had it all my life , you know ?"
O,I also had a collapsed lung .
O,"So , you know , I worry about it all the time ."
O,"Claim was so thoroughly , constantly , the white falls down into the gate ."
O,I wash my hands thoroughly .
O,I'll probably like it needs some time to say .
O,"I mean , this is literal , seriously , not just exaggerate ."
O,"You know , use it , though ."
O,"So in that of Ajak , dishwashing liquid does kill bacteria ."
O,That's the best I could do .
O,"You know , when I'm at a yard , I try to stay ."
O,My distance dealt with it .
O,"You know , when I've got to go to the phone , I'll beat you ."
O,You've got no choice .
O,I've got a couple of stocks that wash out that you don't use the stock to cover the whole phone .
O,"When I'm talking phone , you know , you can avoid nobody ."
O,"So it's totally , totally impossible ."
O,How many people have been using these phones recently ?
O,The ones in the yard .
O,"You know , everybody every day that calls constantly ."
O,"You know , it could be 400 guys out here at a given time ."
O,"And if everybody is piled up on top of each other a little bit , stop ."
O,Start right behind you .
O,"Hey , you know , everybody stand and watch ."
O,Just be awakened notthey at a name call to get on the phone .
O,Have the phone calls increased because the decision to cut off prison visitation .
O,"Yeah , most definitely ."
O,Most definitely .
O,"But they do have , you know , some bleach and water solution that they squirt on a rag and they work the phones or every twenty three guys get off ."
O,They wipe it down for the next one .
O,Get on .
O,So he is doing that .
O,"Now you said you you've washed your hands compulsively , you're worried and yet you go out to the yard alone to use that phone ."
O,"Why do those calls matter to you so much at this point , Foster ?"
O,Because they let my wife and my kids know that I'm all right .
O,"And I can't even express , you know , how they feel like if they don't hear from me , specially my wife ."
O,Thought they'd be in a panic .
O,"Honestly , you know , they need me to call , you know , and I got a need to hear from them just as much ."
O,Just crazy .
O,I'm really feeling the way .
O,"You know , going in here , like is just it seem like it's just a matter of time before you spread all through this place ."
O,"You know , we'll look closer ."
O,We really appreciate your taking time to do this .
O,And please stay safe .
O,OK .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,Dumptruck .
O,Then that's number one .
O,Try to stay safe and stay healthy and place .
O,"Thanks , Foster ."
O,Is this like a normal journal for you or is this one ?
O,"You know , this is normal ."
O,Yeah .
O,My dad told me a long time ago .
O,"You know , some of the stories that I have taking care of patients , just jot them down ."
O,It's kind of like those old chicken soup for the soul .
O,You're just jot down little things that took your heart or that real .
O,It's really special to you or really sad or hard for you .
O,And so I started doing that years ago is where I just dropped .
O,"I'm Mike Baker , a reporter based in Seattle ."
O,"And a couple of weeks ago , I spoke to Tammy ."
O,"Why a Trotsky , a nurse at the hospital that faced really the initial brunt of Corona virus cases and deaths in the United States ."
O,"So at the end of the night , that's hard , like an end of a twelve hour shift ."
O,"I can get my pad , get my journal and then just sit there and kind of process stuff ."
O,Yeah .
O,"When the virus first hit in this hit , it was like , oh , yes , I have this deep thinking and I just want to get this stuff out ."
O,Tammy began a new journal to chronicle what was happening .
O,So I asked her to read from it .
O,"OK , so this was started Friday , February 28 ."
O,This was my first day of a four day stretches charge in our ICU .
O,"That evening , we received the first two covered 19 positive results in two of our patients , one who had just succumb to the virus as the evening nurses were making their way in for their shift ."
O,"Our infectious disease director , Dr. Rito , came to let the staff know that the virus was here and that we had more patient that we needed to test ."
O,I get emotional when I think about that night .
O,We all glanced across the room with a very blank look of shock on our faces .
O,It was very surreal .
O,I immediately thought about my four grandsons that we're supposed to have their monthly slumber party with granny in two weeks .
O,"Knowing that I would have to make that call , letting them know that I wouldn't be able to have this month's slumber party or maybe even the next that my newest little granddaughter of just a year and a half would look and act so much bigger in those next few weeks , while I was unable to see her looking around the room at my other co-workers ."
O,I could tell they were probably thinking of their loved ones as well .
O,Then we all not at our head as if saying yes without a word said it was just understood .
O,Let's do this .
O,The next several days and weeks at work became planned maneuvers like a well oiled machine .
O,The nurses and doctors working so close together to isolate and treat these patients .
O,Yet the art of nursing changed .
O,"As a nurse , I've always felt that if I couldn't help save a life and that patient dies , that I could help the family through the worst day of their life ."
O,And I still would go home feeling rewarded .
O,I might cry all the way home or for weeks or months to come .
O,"But if I comfort the family and guide them through the process of grief , then I still feel like I've done something good , that I have cared and that I've helped now with how we have to isolate these patients ."
O,We are not able to have the families be with their loved ones as they pass .
O,They don't get to spend the last few days of their life with them .
O,They don't get to hold their hand as they take their last breath .
O,"As a nurse , I can't convey my sympathy and put my arms around them ."
O,"At this point , I got mad ."
O,What can I give them ?
O,What last memory did we just change by having to protect them ?
O,Both the family and the community .
O,"These changes are needed under these circumstances , but they are changing the way a nurse provides the care and compassion during this time ."
O,"Now we find ways to show our care and our hearts through the phone by telling them that we remind the patient that their family sends their love , that they called , that they checked in and that they love them ."
O,"And then later on March 20th , I wrote My life changed ."
O,I realized probably for the first time in my career to help others has distanced me from the ones I love .
O,Life is on pause at times .
O,I'm jealous for some of the doctors and nurses that get to go home to their families and small children .
O,As I walk by the kids playroom .
O,One of the bedrooms in my house with the bunk beds and toys and video games .
O,It's quiet .
O,I don't hear the laughs and screams as the three youngest chased each other with Nerf guns several times on my day off .
O,I'd walked by and looked into the room just to see their bunk beds empty .
O,The pillows that say relax and love and nobody's little head on them .
O,"It makes me sad for a moment , but then I have to think when this is over , we're going to have the biggest slumber party ever and they always know granny loves them ."
O,"For that , I'm grateful ."
O,We'll be right back .
