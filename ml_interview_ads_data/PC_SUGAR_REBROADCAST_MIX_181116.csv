O,Hey there Stephen Dubner .
O,This week we're playing you one of our most popular episodes from the archive because we're traveling our American listeners know why .
O,To the rest of you .
O,This is the week that Americans drive hundreds of miles to eat turkey .
O,Which isn't that great honestly and pie which is great .
O,So we thought it'd be a good time to rerelease this episode which is called there's a war on sugar .
O,Is it justified .
O,We'll be back next week with a new episode .
O,If you can't wait that long we've just put out for brand new episodes of Freakonomics Radio Live unstitched your premium .
O,In our live events .
O,We have great guests and cohosts and a live fact checker when we all play a nonfiction game show called Tell Me Something I don't know to hear for new episodes .
O,Go to stitcher premium dot com slash Freakonomics use promo code Freakonomics for one month free .
O,As always thanks for listening .
O,Surely you are familiar with the beloved Autumn Festival that revolves around folk dancing and lots and lots of drinking milk .
O,Tober fast the holiday for drinking milk and doing homework .
O,OK not what you were expecting .
O,Bavaria has October Fest Brigham Young University in Provo Utah has milk topper .
O,Brigham Young being a Mormon university and therefore prohibiting the consumption of among other substances alcohol .
O,People don't drink but we still like to have a lot of fun .
O,Roger Layton communications manager at the BYU library helps produce Oktoberfest .
O,And so we just let's just embrace that let's just enjoy it .
O,We had a very energetic group of German folk dancers come in and perform .
O,We brought in cases in cases of chalk smoke and then as soon as the milk was there and we said go it it basically became a free for all .
O,I think people love it because it is sort of kind of like Tober fest was almost like .
O,You know BYU lite or something like that .
O,That's Brena Oldroyd .
O,She's a BYU student who helped put together Oktoberfest .
O,You know like hey like this is but we love to drink all the time the chocolate milk they're drinking isn't just any chocolate milk it's some pretty legendary chocolate milk made in Buquet use own creamery .
O,You're sure that the party would shock them .
O,No one's going to complain .
O,I mean it may seem a little childish but really people will drink it .
O,It's a friendly it's safe and it's happy .
O,And one of the great things about parting chocolate milk is like well you probably if you're smart you're not going to throw up later .
O,So that's a plus .
O,This all sounds pretty awesome right and wholesome to swapping out beer for chocolate milk .
O,But is chocolate milk really as wholesome as it seems .
O,Do you know how much sugar there is in one cup of chocolate milk .
O,The answer is 24 grams .
O,It's a bit more than you'd find in the same amount of soda .
O,And there are those who argue that the detriments of sugar .
O,Well they argue that from a metabolic standpoint at least milk Tober fest isn't much better than October fest .
O,We started comparing what sugar did versus what alcohol didn't realize .
O,You know what .
O,Sugar and alcohol do the exact same thing .
O,If you've been following health news in the last decade you've likely noticed that there's a war on sugar .
O,An alarming rise in the rate of obesity and related health problems has prompted a nationwide movement to Bandar restrict sugary drinks .
O,How justified is that war .
O,Today's episode was inspired by a question we received .
O,Dear Freakonomics My name is Arnaud .
O,I'm an 11 year old listener from Chicago and I was wondering why sugar isn't considered a drug even though it's addictive and stimulates the brain .
O,Sincerely Soll .
O,OK Saul we'll do our best to answer your question along the way .
O,We will learn some sugar history .
O,Thomas Aquinas way back in the 30s century he pronounced sugar a medicine .
O,We'll hear from some people who fully agree with you .
O,Now alcohol tobacco morphine and heroin clearly meet these four criteria .
O,We'll also hear from some people who don't agree with you .
O,We have no clue .
O,No real good evidence that it's going to do any good whatsoever .
O,And we'll hear all about your sugar habits .
O,Trying to give it up once again .
O,I .
O,Am addicted to sugar I can .
O,From stitcher and Dubnyk productions .
O,This is Freakonomics Radio the podcast that explores the hidden side of everything .
O,Here's your host Stephen Dubner .
O,Before we get into the nitty gritty on sugar let me offer a sort of caveat .
O,In general nutrition studies are not very robust compared to many other fields in biological science .
O,That's Richard Kahn the former chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association .
O,So what's the problem with nutrition studies .
O,There are often no controls no randomization small number of subjects very difficult to conduct very robust long term studies on nutrition .
O,OK .
O,This is a really important points kind of thing we talk about all the time on this program the legitimacy of data yada yada but with nutrition .
O,There are a few things going on that make a particularly tough .
O,Number one this is about something that we all put in our mouths every day which means we all think of ourselves as experts unlike particle physics or financial engineering .
O,This is something we all do all the time so of course we know what we're talking about .
O,Number two most nutrition science is built on survey data that is asking people about what they've eaten or asking them to keep food diaries things like that .
O,Now if you've been paying any attention at all to Freakonomics Radio over the years you know this is a sure fire way to gather some not so realistic or at least not so robust data .
O,And so as Richard Kahn said can be a real challenge to run a really convincing nutrition study because people do not want to participate and don't want to alter their diet patterns for a long time and they don't comply with the regimen of the instructions in the randomised trial .
O,Now if we could take a few thousand people and randomised them and then control every single thing they ate and drank for a few years .
O,I'd be great .
O,But absent that .
O,We do our best .
O,We look for data .
O,We ask questions starting here .
O,So as a public health official in New York and at the national level you've tried to stem aids in TB and pandemic flu you've tried to prepare the public for potential bioterror attacks how in light of those dangers would you rank let's say the consumption of sugar .
O,Well there are very different threats but I think we have to recognise that while acute public health crises you know really demand all of our attention and get a lot of response that .
O,How we live what we eat if we exercise many aspects of our daily lives have the greatest impact on health and disease .
O,That's Margaret Hamburg I am a medic doctor and a public health professional who has served in government at many levels over many years now and most recently as the US FDA commissioner .
O,I wanted to ask you briefly about some FDA definitions that when I read them I have to say they are somewhere between comical and incomprehensible when the FDA defines food food additives drugs and substances generally regarded as safe .
O,So those are the categories which of these definitions apply to sugar .
O,Well you know I have to agree with you that many of the definitions are concentrated meaning I assume you didn't really know the difference between whoever wrote them and the Congress is responsible for some of it and FDA lawyers for some of it .
O,And of course you know many of these laws and regulations and guidances and definitions have evolved over many many years .
O,Yeah but it is complicated and confusing and it's why you know there are almost as many lawyers as scientists if you like for instance the first the very first thing food number one articles used for food or drink for man or other animals so like you were talking about how you could have a nutritious sounding sawdust .
O,I can imagine that could easily fit within FDA regulation FDA guidelines then used for food .
O,Yeah .
O,It's it's really hard to answer a question like the one you just posed to me .
O,I mean sugar is intrinsic to many food products so it's not going to be regulated in the same way that a completely exaggerate this additive to a food product can be regulated and but so technically the categories under which sugar falls however are food additive and goriest and regarded as safe and not food itself correct .
O,Well this is my point and I'm not going to answer your question because I don't have my lawyers here .
O,But no .
O,I mean you know there's there are sugars in fruits and vegetables there sugars in dairy products their sugars and various grasses that that people consume .
O,So .
O,You know it's it's intrinsic to the food product itself .
O,For instance let's get back to chocolate milk for a minute .
O,As we said it's got 24 grams of sugar per 1 cup serving more than some soda but regular old milk without the chocolate .
O,That's about 12 grams of sugar .
O,It's naturally sweet from the lactose .
O,And then there's the sugar that's added to many foods products that you think are actually very healthy .
O,You know yogurt the levels of sugar are astonishingly high .
O,Things like barbecue sauce and spaghetti sauce and soup actually have much higher levels of sugar than you would ever imagine not to mention you know the levels that are in you know pies and cakes and icecream and things where you would expect to see sugar .
O,So how much sugar overall do we actually consume .
O,So right now we are about 60 to 65 percent over our limit and that's average .
O,That's Robert Lustig a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine also a member of their Institute for Health Policy Studies .
O,My job is to try to treat obese children and now also alter the global food supply from easy picking the low hanging fruit for yourself I see .
O,Yeah .
O,Easier said than done on both counts .
O,The data vary .
O,Again this is nutrition science we're talking about .
O,But the most recent estimates show that Americans consume between 20 and 30 teaspoons of added sugar per day .
O,That's down a bit from our peak consumption sometime around the early 2000s .
O,But Americans still consume more added sugar than anyone else and this has turned Robert Lustig into one of the most outspoken sugar critics .
O,You will find he came to this position over many years .
O,I'm a pediatric endocrinologist .
O,I take care of glandular hormonal problems in children and I was doing that pretty seamlessly for a good two to three decades and then the kids started getting fat on me .
O,And the question was you know what's going on .
O,So we started looking at what sugar did to the body and what we realized was it caused this thing called insulin resistance and particularly in the liver .
O,And so we started comparing what sugar did versus what alcohol didn't realized you know what .
O,Sugar and alcohol were the exact same thing and makes sense that it should .
O,Because after all where do you get alcohol from fermentation of sugar .
O,And so we were now seeing the diseases of alcohol without the alcohol .
O,And so that started my shall we say advocacy in this field of obesity and public health .
O,If you are indeed overweight or obese you wanna lose weight .
O,The first place to start is to reduce sugar consumption .
O,That again is Richard Kahn formerly of the American Diabetes Association .
O,The reason being that we get plenty of energy from other carbohydrates we don't have to rely on sugar to get our energy .
O,And the second reason is that sugar itself does not come along with any other essential nutrients vitamins or minerals .
O,So you might think that Con Ed Lustig are in precisely the same camp but there you'd be wrong .
O,Well there's no question that there is a real obesity epidemic throughout the world so that I think is very real and it's very important and it's very serious and it has clear adverse health consequences .
O,In addition that has led to I believe has led directly to a dramatic increase in the incidence of diabetes throughout the world .
O,We first saw this in the United States where we've seen it in European countries we're now seeing it in Asian countries .
O,So diabetes is clearly a serious disease it has quite serious complications and that's a problem .
O,So then the question becomes what has caused the obesity epidemic .
O,And that is .
O,To use the euphemism 64000 dollar question .
O,There are many potential contributors to the rise in obesity .
O,So there's been some evidence that with the increased use of psychotropic drugs anti depressive drugs drugs for schizophrenia and other mental disorders those drugs tend to promote weight gain .
O,Another possibility is that we've seen clearly smoking cessation in a large proportion of the population and when people stop smoking that's usually been associated with weight gain .
O,So psychotropic drugs smoking cessation potential infections have been attributed to a rise in obesity .
O,There's also a lot of research arguing the rather obvious point that we consume more calories today than we used to .
O,For a lot of reasons the relative low cost of food the deliciousness of food the availability of food especially the availability of cheap delicious sweet food .
O,OK so many people do believe that sugar consumption has been the cause is the cause of our obesity epidemic and then subsequently diabetes but I believe that the evidence for this is pretty weak when the city of San Francisco wanted to add warning labels to soda cans submitted an expert report on behalf of among others the American Beverage Association .
O,He wrote quote There is no scientific consensus that added sugar including added sugar in beverages plays a unique role in the development of obesity and diabetes .
O,So if we look as an analogy for example to cigarette smoking and try to make the link between sugar and obesity or diabetes and cigarette smoking to cancer and say well OK what's been what's the differences .
O,OK what are the differences in the cigarette smoking realm .
O,The lowest smoking rate produced an enormous incidence of lung cancer and the highest rate of smoking was just simply off the charts in terms of the likelihood of developing lung cancer .
O,Conversely with sugar consumption it's less than a two fold increase at the highest levels .
O,This gets into tricky territory as Khan says some studies do find a two fold increase in diabetes at the highest rate of sugar consumption but other analyses including one by Robert Lustig argue that it's considerably higher .
O,That said the relationship between sugar and obesity is nowhere near as strong as the relationship between smoking and lung cancer .
O,According to the National Institutes of Health even late smoking results in a nine fold increase the next one is something called temporality .
O,In other words is there a association in time between sugar consumption and obesity .
O,So that held true from about 1985 to the year 2000 where there was as obesity levels went up sugar consumption went up but thereafter starting in the year 2000 even to today sugar consumption has declined somewhere around 15 to 20 per cent whereas obesity rates continue to rise .
O,We don't see that at all with smoking .
O,The analogous situation in cigarette smoking rises cancer rises cigarette smoking declines cancer declines .
O,This of course doesn't mean that sugar doesn't contribute to obesity just that again the relationship isn't so definitive .
O,Kahn points to another difference between smoking and sugar in cigarette smoking .
O,We found a link between cigarette smoking and cancer in every population every ethnicity both genders all kinds of tobacco use and even bystanders .
O,Conversely in with sugar we don't have that consistency whatsoever .
O,For instance some studies show a strong relationship between weight gain and sugar sweetened beverages as has bees .
O,But that relationship is most consistent when the SS bees are consumed in addition to a person's regular diet .
O,So the problem might simply be the extra calories not the sugar per se .
O,Could also be that people who drink a lot of sugary drinks do other things that lead to weight gain .
O,There's also the fact that as Richard Kahn said earlier in general nutrition studies are not very robust compared to many other fields in biological science in sugar consumption .
O,Most of them have been neither know controls a very small number of subjects they've only lasted for days or weeks at the most .
O,So the experimental studies have not been robust .
O,So in Khan's view the science on sugar is not settled which means that the notion of regulating sugar is at best premature .
O,I don't think that there's any absolute amount of sugar that we should be under in our consumption .
O,I think that it all relates to eating a well-rounded diet .
O,Robert Lustig .
O,Meanwhile the time for regulation is now .
O,So this episode was inspired by a listener who wrote in to say essentially you know if sugar is as bad for us as a lot of people are now saying it is why isn't it regulated the way other potentially harmful substances like alcohol or tobacco are regulated .
O,How do you answer that question .
O,Well the public health community has identified four separate criteria that are needed to be fulfilled before a substance can be considered for regulation .
O,Those four are number one Ubiquiti that is can't get away from it .
O,Number two toxicity .
O,It's dangerous .
O,Number three abused that increased consumption and is inherent in the molecule itself .
O,And finally number four is externalities that is your consumption hurts me now .
O,Alcohol Tobacco morphine and heroin clearly meet these four criteria and so the question is does sugar meet them .
O,And the answer is yes it does absolutely .
O,OK let's look at those four criteria for sugar ubiquity .
O,That's pretty much a no brainer .
O,What about toxicity Lustiger hypothesis has to do with how the body handles fructose .
O,So when you consume dietary sugar the glucose molecules can go anywhere in the body only about 20 percent hit the liver but the fructose molecules have to be handled in the liver because there's a specific transporter called the glute five transporter .
O,It is only in the liver .
O,So when you consume a soda you are flooding your liver and your liver basically can handle the flood and the liver has no choice but to turn that fructose into liver fat and it's that liver fat that causes the chronic metabolic disease .
O,And we have the data now that demonstrates that it's the liver fat made from dietary sugar that is at the nights at the beginning of type 2 diabetes heart disease fatty liver disease and we're starting to ferret out the links between dietary sugar and cancer and dementia as well .
O,But I know there's other research that says that the toxicity argument may be overstated that it's you know not an acute toxin maybe but a chronic one .
O,You are absolutely right that sugar is not an acute toxin .
O,So chronic toxins are still toxins even though they don't make you keel over and die is benzene a toxin we regulated as such .
O,Yet benzene doesn't kill you acutely .
O,What about alcohol .
O,Alcohol is both an acute toxin .
O,So I mean you can basically die on a bender or it's a chronic tox and you can fry your liver .
O,It's both .
O,The point is that the FDA regulates acute toxins because it's in their charter .
O,The Food Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938 very specifically it does not say anything about chronic toxins .
O,And so the FDA does not regulate chronic toxins .
O,Criterion number three for regulation .
O,The potential for abuse it turns out that there is no biochemical reaction in any vertebrate on the planet that requires dietary fructose .
O,Now it happens to be sweet .
O,It happens to signal our brain reward centers that we like the stuff we happen to crave it .
O,We happen to really enjoy it and a little too much .
O,And in fact now we have data that shows that it just happens to be addictive as well .
O,So the question about whether sugar can meet the criteria for an addiction or an abuse substance is something that I've been studying for many years now it's something that I think has become of interest to a lot of people .
O,That's Dr. Nicole Avina .
O,She is a research neuroscientist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York .
O,The way in which we've been studying this and the way in which others have studied this is to use these DSM criteria for addiction and basically to ask the question Can sugar when it's consumed and excess produce some of these behavioral indications and neurochemical indications that you would typically see with a substance of abuse .
O,The DSM is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
O,It defines addiction or substance abuse along four main criteria impaired control social impairment risky use and pharmacological indicators like tolerance and withdrawal .
O,You certainly don't need to meet all of them and many people who are addicts don't meet all those criteria but you do need to meet a certain number of them for a protracted period of time .
O,And what the research has suggested in both animal models and in clinical studies is that in fact yes we do see that the criteria for addiction as we classically define it in the DSM can be met when the substance of abuse is in fact a sugar or in fact a palatable food in many cases .
O,And so we see evidence of bingeing we see evidence of withdrawal evidence of craving .
O,We also see changes in the brain .
O,Now it's worth pointing out that some of the most troubling studies are animal studies which can be problematic on two fronts .
O,One the lab animals aren't people so they processed sugar differently and to the doses of sugar the animals receiving the lab are often so large as to not be comparable to what most people would consume .
O,Moreover sugar isn't the only thing we consume that has addictive qualities .
O,Pizza and french fries are also at the top of the list .
O,So how well does this emerging model of sugar addiction line up to the addictive criteria for the sort of drugs that we do regulate .
O,It's a difficult question because I I do think that sugar is safe when it's used in moderation .
O,But the problem is that I think that most people are unaware of how much sugar they're consuming and also if the data suggests that the sugar is producing addictive like changes in the brain then now we're talking about something very different because if you're starting out now no longer be able to have full volitional control over your decision to eat or not eat their sugar then that becomes I think a different type of discussion .
O,The fourth criteria for regulation .
O,Robert Lustig was telling us about externalities and that is your consumption hurts me a classic case of externalities is auto travel .
O,Every time you drive it costs me something whether I'm driving or not .
O,More pollution or congestion or risk of accident .
O,We share all those costs regardless of my actions .
O,So the question is does this fit for sugar .
O,I mean do I have anything to say about your consumption .
O,And the answer is yeah you're costing me in obesity related health care whether I'm obese or not because of your obesity .
O,It's economic but it's real because sixty 62 percent of all the health care costs in this country are shouldered by the federal government .
O,So damn right we share it .
O,Coming up on Freakonomics Radio .
O,OK .
O,Having heard what we've heard about sugar .
O,How would you think about regulating it .
O,Not sure that I can really embrace the proposal to regulate sugar in that way and we'll find one sugar facts .

O,It's hard to find anyone who doesn't like sugar and nearly just as hard to find anyone who doesn't think that they're having too much of it .
O,I really like it .
O,I know it's bad for you but I like it .
O,All right now I am staying away from Shergar .
O,So right now I'm just trying to eat better have a better diet by trying to cut back on it .
O,But I've never given it up .
O,I think it tastes delicious in the right thing and I think that this point it's probably an addiction that our body my body just needs to have so that I've .
O,Never tried to give it up nor will I .
O,Give it up any time soon .
O,I'm definitely eating too much of it because .
O,I had .
O,Of safety .
O,My friends and because we believe .
O,It wasn't always thus .
O,Sugar started out as a minor commodity that was used for medicine and for spice up until oh I would say into the middle ages .
O,That's Elizabeth Abbott .
O,She teaches history at Trinity College University of Toronto .
O,She's the author of sugar a bittersweet history .
O,She says the debate over what sugar is a food drug or something in between is not new .
O,Thomas Aquinas way back in the 30s when he pronounced sugar a medicine he said though nutritious in themselves sugared spices are nonetheless not eaten with the end in mind of nourishment but rather for ease indigestion .
O,Accordingly they do not break the fast any more than the taking of any other medicine .
O,One reason sugar was welcome in medicine was because a lot of medicine tasted terrible .
O,It was a combination of Bitter Roots animal feces even bits of corpse .
O,So yeah spoonful of sugar really does make the medicine go down .
O,Outside of medicine however sugar was decidedly aristocratic for example Persia or Iran .
O,Today it was very very popular among the elite and they are the ones that started this this trend this architecture of sugar and they would make beautiful sculptures often like for example lifesize trees sugar was costly and sugar was rare but the sugar trade began to grow built on the back of the slave trade .
O,So by 16 80 sugar costs only half what it had in 16 30 .
O,That was thanks to slavery by 7900 .
O,The percentage of imported foodstuffs including sugar had more than doubled and quadrupled between 7500 and 1740 and England and Wales consumed 60 times more 6 0 times more sugar though their populations did not quite double .
O,Abbott argues that it was the Industrial Revolution that helped turn sugar into an everyday thing .
O,People started going from their farms and so on into cities and into factories and they couldn't go home for lunch because they had you know maybe 50 minute break .
O,So sugared tea and byan or or some sort of thing like that with often with jam on it was offered instead .
O,And that was what popularized it .
O,It said that it fuelled the industrial revolution because sugar tea and it would be really sugary has calories and they're not nutritious but they are units of energy the sugar boom helped create another boom that we're still living through .
O,They had a lobby that was extremely powerful .
O,I think that we could see all the big heavy industrial lobbying probably stems from the success of the sugar lobby .
O,That's right .
O,It wasn't enough to benefit from slave labour and huge demand for their product .
O,The sugar plantations were profitable not just because of the demand but largely because of how they were politically strong .
O,If they had failures if they had hurricanes if they had bad crops which they often did they could keep the price they could get parliament to help them out with that with good legislation and tariffs and so on that would favor them .
O,And by the way the sugar lobby is still a very important one and it has a lot of weight still and it now is sort of an alliance of cane sugar planters and beet sugar planters and they do get together to to lobby when when they feel that their interests are at stake .
O,It was only recently uncovered that in the 1960s the sugar industry paid three Harvard scientists to write a review that shifted the blame for heart disease from sugar to saturated fat .
O,Much more recently Coca-Cola spent millions of dollars on research arguing that the real culprit in obesity is lack of exercise not sugary drinks so it can't blame people for being confused maybe conflicted about the degree to which sugar is a health risk .
O,I brought this up with Robert Lustig .
O,Let me just ask you right now we're talking in the year 2017 a lot of people now are convinced that the US government and many others erred terribly in declaring fat to be the enemy or at least the enemy of the scope that it was declared to be to be the cause of obesity and that and many people now believe as you argue that sugar is a much bigger villain .
O,How do we know you're not the guy that's wrong this time that you're not just another perhaps even well-intentioned big brained do gooder who's making a massive mistake an awfully good question .
O,So this is known as the pessimistic met induction theory and what it says is well everything we knew ten years ago is already wrong and everything we know today will be wrong ten years from now .
O,So why should we do anything differently when we know that whatever it is that we believe today will end up being wrong .
O,So if you play that game then you might as well never do any research .
O,Never do anything at all and just basically live with the current dogma .
O,There's also the confounding fact as pointed out by former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg that a lot of time you're eating sugar when you don't know you're eating sugar .
O,Things like barbecue sauce and spaghetti sauce and soup actually have much higher levels of sugar than you would ever imagine .
O,Talk to me for a moment about the Smart Choices Program and what the FDA did there .
O,Well the Smart Choices Program was an effort spearheaded by industry a number of major food producing companies came together to create a system where you would give different scores to different aspects of the nutritional value of a product and the total number would then either give you the green chair of a smart choice or not .
O,The title I got the name I gather was an industry name .
O,Yes not exactly .
O,I mean the problem with that was that you could score .
O,Adequately high to get that green smart choice check without the food truly reflecting I think what any sensible nutrition expert would view as a healthy smart choice .
O,You know some of the products that got the the smart choice label you know were very high in sugar .
O,You know over 40 percent sugar .
O,We joked that you could practically take sawdust and if you added enough nutrients to add in the fiber of sawdust you know you could have it labeled as a as a healthy choice a smart choice right .
O,So how long did that last .
O,So it was it was out there for a little while .
O,We expressed our concerns to the group that had put this together and was implementing it .
O,And I think they they listened and understood and they decided voluntarily to withdraw the program .
O,And there have been a number of efforts to look at other strategies for providing consumers with important information about foods .
O,The Nutrition Facts label of course is one important aspect but the Nutrition Facts label that's on most processed foods and beverages in this country was first put into place .
O,Now more than two decades ago but then it was never updated .
O,And so when I was commissioner we decided it really did need to be updated to reflect both a deeper understanding about how people eat you know serving size for example but also advances in nutrition science .
O,And so we embarked on a process to update it .
O,I think the most important contribution that this updated nutrition facts label provides is in the area of added sugar as I understand it .
O,Food and beverage companies are already adjusting their products to consider the new labeling .
O,Was that your intention .
O,Well absolutely one of the goals of putting out that information is to encourage companies to reformulate foods towards you know healthier products .
O,And we've certainly seen that happen as we've moved towards this the implementation of this new nutrition facts label Stonyfield yogurt I believe just recently decided to significantly reduce levels of sugar before the new facts label is actually in place .
O,FDA in some ways .
O,Has the opportunity to use both the carrot and the stick you know knowing that we we could do mandatory guidelines on certain things .
O,It often encouraged industry to work with us to come to voluntary approaches but there's no doubt that you know there are tensions .
O,So Robert Lustig like several others in that camp argue that that sugar should be regulated substantially because it meets criteria for substances that should be controlled or regulated unavoidably the toxicity potential for abuse and negative impact on society .
O,So I'm curious what your thoughts are on sugar fitting those criteria whether you think that's even a useful framework .
O,I think that we need to reduce excess sugar .
O,In our diets and in the products that we consume .
O,I think consumers need more education and information .
O,But I'm not sure that I can really embrace the proposal to regulate sugar in that way because it would be too overreaching because it would be too difficult .
O,Why .
O,It's a complex area to regulate in that sugars you know are intrinsic components of many foods many foods which should be part of a balanced nutritious diet .
O,Fruits and vegetables and dairy products are good examples .
O,And I think that you know some of the concerns that have been raised you know may not be fully grounded in the best possible science not fully grounded in the best possible science that you'll recall was Richard Condes main objection to the idea of regulating sugar .
O,But there's another one too .
O,OK so if you reduce it or get rid of it or put policies and laws regulating it what good is it going to do .
O,And we have no clue no real good evidence that it's going to do any good whatsoever and therefore unintended consequences become a very important factor .
O,Robert Lustig meanwhile is as you have likely figured out by now in favor of just about any kind of sugar regulation you can imagine taxes for instance and price hikes both of which worked to reduce cigarette smoking and are already being used on sugary drinks in a few places .
O,Well the the modeling studies that have been done suggests that you have to raise the price of a can of soda by about 20 percent in order to see any meaningful reduction in consumption .
O,Lustig is also in favor of limiting the availability of sugar removing vending machines from schools for instance also banning TV commercials for products with added sugar .
O,Also getting rid of subsidies subsidies for food .
O,Make no sense because subsidies distort the market .
O,OK .
O,One last question perhaps ridiculous or impossible but let's say we're in a world where you could edit genes quite easily and it seems we're not that far from it .
O,Whether we're talking about a 50 year old person or as I go how would you consider editing the genes related to what seems to be a craving perhaps even dangerous craving for sugar .
O,Well that's a really tough question .
O,We don't want to turn off our reward system entirely if we do we actually get into trouble .
O,We actually did this .
O,We did this experiment with a medicine back in the early 2000s that medicine was called Ramana bant and what it was was it was the anti marijuana medicine .
O,It blocked the endocannabinoid receptors in the brain .
O,And by doing so reduced reward for alcohol and for food .
O,And in fact people who took Romanova and lost a fair amount of weight and that looked very promising until we started looking at the Phase 3 data and started realizing that a lot of these people became severely depressed and in fact many of them committed suicide and we didn't realize that until we did those Phase 3 trials .
O,And it was never approved here in the United States .
O,Bottom line is if you take away a reward you take away the reason for living so be careful about gene editing our rewards system .
O,Most of the regulatory measures that Robert Lustig would like to see around sugar lie somewhere between unlikely and impossible least for now .
O,In any case we asked a bunch of people in Times Square what they thought of most of such a venture .
O,Here's one of the best things in the world .
O,I don't think it should be taxed either .
O,Probably a tax but not a bad .
O,Just .
O,A ban would work very well but maybe a tax would .
O,Have people thinking about what they're buying .
O,Want to back .
O,Up Dokdo bad car really bad .
O,Because it will look at the back and the Revolutionary War .
O,Brisker attacks on tea .
O,People don't really like that too much so .
O,I would like my kids ILOs .
O,A love of sugar seems from what we can tell pretty universal including among the scientists and doctors we've been speaking with today from Richard Kahn formerly of the American Diabetes Association .
O,One clear thing that comes to mind is just pleasure .
O,I mean sugar is enjoyable to eat as part of our culture it's keeping our community together our families together too .
O,Margaret Hamburg former FDA commissioner Well I will admit to having a sweet tooth .
O,I do enjoy oatmeal cookies .
O,I'll tell you with my my particular vice to the most anti sugar one of all .
O,Dr. Robert Lustig .
O,I mean sugars celebratory sugars you know fun sugars .
O,You know Apple Pie a sugar is you know reward but once a week .
