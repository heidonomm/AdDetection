O,At this altitude I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking .
O,Can I ask you a personal question .
O,Now the scene in .
O,Reality .
O,I'm a cybernetic organisms living tissue . I will never end this .
O,Me .
O,There .
O,Is .
O,No .
O,Well hello boys and girls ladies and germs my esteemed and lovely listeners .
O,Short version I'm getting rid of ads and sponsors for a six month test and the podcast will continue to be free 100 percent free .
O,Nothing behind a paywall and you can learn more about that and why at Tim DOT Blog forward slash support .
O,That's Tim DOT Blog for such support .
O,I'd really appreciate if you listen to this message in full .
O,Tonight can be super long .
O,So here is a little bit more .
O,Thousands of you fans readers listeners have asked me over the years how can I thank you .
O,I want to thank you on Twitter and all sorts of other places .
O,What can I do to thank you besides buy your books .
O,And I've never had a product I've never wanted to just come up with a product or a course or fill in the blank .
O,Nonetheless nearly 400 episodes with the podcast later for under million or so downloads a thousand plus blog posts and so on .
O,I've thought about this and I've thought about it a lot recently because the sponsorship model and I actually look at the calendar it's great on a lot of levels but it cuts into time and resources .
O,I'm not learning very much and it's an elegant model in some respects .
O,I don't think advertising or sponsorship is evil and I turn away 90 plus percent of my sponsor increase anyway test everything reject another 90 percent and only share the stuff I end up using personally .
O,So I don't feel badly about that at all .
O,I feel really good about it
O,but it chews up a ton of time and energy for me and my team which I would rather spend on doing more experiments doing more crazy pushing the envelope stuff that I can then report on and share with you
O,that is in my power zone and it's why many of you ended up reading my books or listening to this podcast in the first place so I'd rather do more of that sort of less hustle more art and experiment .
O,So this seems to be that is a fan supported model the most direct way to fix this and it's just the cleanest most attractive way to go about it .
O,I want to simplify simplify simplify do more experiments do really really cool stuff like for instance . You've seen me support studies for treatment resistant depression at Johns Hopkins and other places
O,I want to do more of that kind of thing .
O,I want to do all sorts of wacky things that I can then report back on .
O,And look if we try the fans sport model for six months and it doesn't work then we go back to sponsors because the podcast has really become the machine the engine that feeds everything else .
O,And I want to have a positive dent in the world and the fuel for a lot of that comes from the podcast .
O,And what do you get for that .
O,You don't get a beer cozy I'm not going to tell you a bunch of garbage that you don't want .
O,It's really if you just feel awesome about supporting what I want to do in the world and the experiments I want to conduct and the learnings I want to share and so on .
O,That's it .
O,So if my book if the podcast if anything has had a significant impact on you or people who love it anyway just consider giving a few bucks a month to it and you can find it at Tim DOT Blog for such support .
O,You can finish the entire process in less than two minutes .
O,Tim DOT Blog fought such support .
O,If it doesn't feel great to do don't do it
O,you don't have to pay for it .
O,It's always going to be free .
O,It's never gonna be behind a paywall
O,so don't sweat it .
O,It should feel awesome you should feel really good about doing it . If you do it at all
O,and if you don't don't do it
O,really you're just going to have an upgraded listener experience for the next six months without sponsors .
O,And if this experiment fails meaning the fan sports stuff then we'll go back to the sponsorship model .
O,OK .
O,Check it out .
O,Teamed up blog for slash support and it would really mean a lot .
O,And it also gave me an opportunity to see how many diehards are there how many people out there would actually want to support in this way .

O,Thank you for coming to visit us .
O,And we're going to jump all over chronologically which is my my habit .
O,I try to turn that bug into a feature we'll see how I do .
O,And a flashback to childhood .
O,So were you a well-behaved child or do you have any memories of misbehaving getting in trouble .
O,Yeah so I was a super well behaved child like borderline nerd . Actually
O,I was the kid that didn't have a curfew because I actually called my parents before it was time to come home to let them know when I would be home .
O,But I did get in trouble once in a very big way and I will tell you what happened .
O,I decided I wanted to get a second piercing in my ear and my mother said absolutely not .
O,I was eleven years old and that was completely inappropriate to have a second piercing in your ear
O,and I had one friend .
O,She was my most rebellious friend .
O,Her name was Laura and we decided to take the bus to the White Plains Galleria mall and we were going to get our ear pierced anyway .
O,And so we did .
O,We took the bus and she convinced me that it was no big deal and my mom wouldn't even see it .
O,So I just came home and I put my thing over my hair and you know my mom actually didn't notice it .
O,And so I told her I don't actually think she noticed that I was actually such a nerd . I told her that
O,I couldn't do it for more than five minutes that telling her that I met your peers .
O,So I admitted that I got my ear piercing my mom decided that a great punishment for me .
O,Well first she called the woman who pierced my ear to explain that you actually couldn't you know put holes in the body of minors without their parental consent .
O,And the woman didn't seem to really care that my mom thought that and she said well if you don't like it then you should sue me .
O,So my mom decided that she would not only to teach my daughter a lesson .
O,She decided that she was going to sue her for eight dollars and ninety nine cents the entire contents of my piggy bank that I took to get my ear pierced and that I was going to have to take the stand .
O,Yes and that's exactly what happened with my punishment .
O,My mom went to the library and she was her own lawyer and she figured out that yes in fact you could not pierce the body of a minor without parental consent .
O,And then I had to go to court and get up on the stand as the most terrified 11 year old that you have ever seen to tell them that yes I had disobeyed my parents and gone to the galleria mall and got my second piercing
O,home mom .
O,So what did your parents do professionally .
O,My dad was a physics teacher and my mom was .
O,She had actually an antique business when people moved from homes or estates . She praises the contents and sells them off .
O,She's kind of like an art historian
O,and you said White Plains .
O,So where do you grew up .
O,I grew up in West Chester New York
O,Westchester .
O,All right we're gonna flash forward as promised to a year before solar cycle .
O,Could you paint a picture for us .
O,Where are you .
O,What's going on in life .
O,Yes .
O,So I have had this is just about my third career .
O,I started out my first career was I worked in the movie business
O,as a kid . I had always been obsessed with theater with musical theater that was always kind of my thing .
O,I loved entertainment and I always wanted to figure out a way to work in the movie business .
O,And I remember coming home you know my sophomore year of college and saying to my dad who was a gym teacher and my mom who worked in an antique business like Don't you people know anybody I need an internship somewhere .
O,This is never gonna happen for me unless we know somebody .
O,And my dad recalled that he had worked with some woman whose husband ran a kid's talent agency cut to I got some internship and long story short I . I did find my way into the movie business and I worked in New York for about eight years as a commercial agent and I kind of figured out that if I really wanted to go to the next place in my life I would need to go to California .
O,And so I went to L.A. and I became a manager in Los Angeles and I did that for about 10 years .
O,And after ten years I kind of flash forward and ahead to what people's lives looked like you know in the entertainment business servicing clients all the time .
O,Kind of you know really being you know a prisoner to a lifestyle of servicing people .
O,And although I loved artists which is what I was always in it for I really thought to myself like I'm kind of ready to go back to the east coast .
O,I'm kind of ready to make a change and I came back to the east coast and I my husband and I both went into our offices on the same day at the time I met my my husband in Los Angeles .
O,He was an agent at William Morris and I was working for a management company and we decided we were gonna head off for sort of nobler professions and head back to the east coast .
O,Keep it real
O,and we got up one morning and we lived in Malibu at the time it was sort of like our swan song we decided to move to Malibu on the beach because we knew we were going to head out of the West Coast and we got up one morning and we said okay . Today's the day like we're both going to go quit our jobs and we're going to tell everybody goodbye and like we're going back to the east coast
O,and my husband and I we left that morning and he came home and I came home at the end of the day and we said had to go and he said Oh yeah .
O,Everybody said you know great job .
O,Thanks a lot whatever and you know I'm all I'm all good .
O,And I said oh well they told me that they were gonna move my assistant a month ahead of me and that I should take a month on the road and that I could do this in New York if I wanted to and then I started thinking like how are we going to pay our rent .
O,So I get my job .
O,So basically the picture was that I came back to New York and I was running a New York office for the agency that I'd worked for in Los Angeles and I was still working in the movie business and I was you know really you know having a better time doing it here but definitely beginning to think about kind of what's next .
O,I mean I'd been thinking about what was next already when I was thinking about leaving the West Coast and the one thing that was really going on for me here in New York was that in L.A. You know so much of my life had been tied up in lifestyle pursuit .
O,You know I went hiking with my friends .
O,I belong to a running club .
O,We lived at the beach .
O,And when I came back to New York there was just nothing here that was lifestyle
O,fitness was really about going to a big box gym burning calories having somebody yell at you about you know were you beating the person next to you could you push harder .
O,You know how could you you know get it done quicker and more efficiently .
O,And you know it's interesting cut to 2006 .
O,You know there was no green juice in this city .
O,There was no boutique fitness .
O,There were a couple of yoga studios but certainly what's going on today was not what was going on you know in 2006 in New York and so for me there was a real void
O,even though I was desperate to come back to the east coast and be with my family . There certainly was a void in what I had experienced in Los Angeles in terms of lifestyle .
O,So I want to talk about just for a moment managing tell it .
O,So what is what does a manager do .
O,And based on what you just said which you said several things but one of which was they said .
O,Great we'll give you a bunch of time off and you can then pick up with your job .
O,You .
O,I would imagine we're good at that job .
O,So what does a manager do and what were some of your better bets or better decisions as a manager .
O,Sure .
O,So a manager you know an agent is responsible for getting actors jobs and a publicist is responsible for making sure that people know about those jobs and a lawyer is making sure they make him that they don't get screwed over in the contracts for those jobs
O,and kind of what a manager does is think about big picture
O,you really think about who that person is who they want to be in the world .
O,What I learned actually from being a manager is you're really thinking about creating a brand for a person .
O,You know what is that person's brand
O,you know what does it's how do they walk through the world what do they stand for
O,you know what do people think about when you know when they think about an actor and actress everything from their fashions the things that they endorse to you know the way that they talk in interviews and really thinking in terms of you know how do I plan a career not just a job to job for this person .
O,And .
O,When you get to L.A. or got to L.A. you transition to this . This job as a manager .
O,Were there any any particular winds or fines from the perspective of telling people you chose to work with her ended up working with the couple that come to mind if you can talk about .
O,I definitely can .
O,Well I will definitely say that I think that you know one of my sort of better skills in life is picking people .
O,I've seen that I agree .
O,I'm a very good people I think I have . I've just about the greatest husband .
O,I chose a fantastic business partner and I feel actually very lucky in my life with my friends and the people that are around me are all dynamic and really feed me . And you know in very specific ways .
O,But I've always been a good people picker and I genuinely love people and what I really love is I love the nuances that make people . The people that they are .
O,And you know those little things about people that are special are things that I feel like I can really see and something that I love doing in the world is trying to help figure out how to connect the world to the things that are special about those people .
O,And so I've had good luck all along .
O,You know early on in my career I Ellen Pompeo was a bartender that wouldn't give me a drink .
O,And when I finally gave her my card and her boyfriend found it in the laundry a couple months later she called me and we had quite a good run .
O,I worked with some of Larry for a while I worked with Justin Long and then when I was in Hollywood I worked on the teams of people
O,I worked for a bigger company but I worked on the teams for people like Jennifer Lopez and Sean Combs and will smith and those were not necessarily people that I found but I was actually really lucky to be a part of those teams because I worked for somebody a guy named Benny Medina who's like a very famous talent manager .
O,He's created a lot of incredible artists and really he was one of the first people that really thought about how you create artists into brands .
O,He would take somebody like Jennifer Lopez and think how can we release an album on the same day as we release a movie on the same day as we put a fragrance into the world .
O,And I think that was pretty early thinking back then in terms of 360 you thinking about how you could turn a person into a company .
O,Let's let's flashback to Ellen he mentioned a bartender a
O,bartender .
O,What did you see in that .
O,No .
O,As is context for me as well as people who are listening to do the most successful iconic managers have five clients 50 clients 100 clients .
O,What does that tend to look like in terms of the number of people you work with and then what did you see in Alan
O,Shore .
O,So it's when you're starting out you know it's much more you know you're betting and you're betting on on more people right .
O,So usually in the beginning you start with about 25 or 30 people you're you know
O,first of all your ability to sign you're not you're not going .
O,You're not you know me at twenty five in the world saying to J Lo like hey come on with me .
O,You know that's not happening .
O,So you know you're you're you're trying to identify talent you're trying to find people that you think are going to have trajectory and you're usually signing between 20 and 25 of them and then watching their you know how their different careers are advancing
O,as your clients become more successful what winds up happening is you personally handle less people because now you're really building companies and if things are going great you're actually producing things you're looking for properties for them .
O,You know you're really overseeing pretty much every decision for them and so you're probably at that point handling between their megastars you're having between one and three if they're big stars you're having between three and five you know and if you have a bunch of people on you know TV series and other things you know I'm going to say that once you're once your clients are successful you don't have more than 10 that you're personally handling .
O,You might have a team of people below you that are handling a bunch and you're kind of saying yes to that no to that whatever but you're a hands on with I'm going to say between three and five .
O,And what do you see in Ellen .
O,What what made you think .
O,And the reason I'm asking this just for people wondering why is he drilling so deeply on this is that whether you think of yourselves as investors or not you are all investors in the sense that you're allocating your hours you're allocating your attention .
O,And so in a way her choosing clients is putting together an investment portfolio .
O,I mean you're placing bets and you have finite number of bets you can place .
O,So why why Ellen what did you would do say
O,you know I saw in Ellen interestingly enough what I ultimately wound up looking for and Soul Cycle instructors what I ultimately look for in employees and what I actually do ultimately look for in entrepreneurs which is you know there was something about her that made me want to know her .
O,That made me want to understand what she was thinking what she was going to be doing .
O,You know when I when I when I used to audition sales cycle instructors I would say the main criteria that I had for a sole cycle instructor was do I want to have a whole meal with you .
O,You know I'm talking about an appetizer an entree and dessert . And I'm still not bored of you
O,you know really you know how do you connect to people .
O,And you know watching her there was something that was there was something it was just fascinating about her .
O,There was something that was really deep that I wanted her to tell me .
O,And I think that's really interesting I think that you know there are certain kinds of people that you really want to lean into .
O,And when I for I sort of have that instinct when my body kind of wants to lean into somebody to know a little bit more I genuinely know that that's a person that I need to sort of surround myself with because there's something about that person that is you know interesting for me .
O,So we're back into Soul Cycle that which is perfect .
O,When did Soul Cycle become something real in the sense that there was a concrete . Action of some type of taking it from in the head to into the world in some way .
O,Right .
O,That's what actually separates the boys from the men right .
O,I always say everybody's got an idea tucked away somewhere .
O,Yeah .
O,So .
O,I was working in New York .
O,I was still working in the town business and I was taking classes at many different gyms just sort of trying to find something that you know . Fulfilled me in terms of exercise .
O,I'm a anxious person .
O,Exercise is a real must for me in my life to sort of keep myself and everybody around me and you know in good spirits .
O,And I I just couldn't find anything that was enjoyable and I kept thing to myself like this could be different this could be fun .
O,This could make you feel good .
O,And I was taking classes with an indoor cycling instructor at a gym and I became friendly with her and I just kept saying all those things to her .
O,And finally she said to me you know there's a woman that takes some classes with me at another gym and she's been saying the same thing to me you guys should meet for lunch .
O,And so she connected me with my business partner who's right there and my other my my other soulmate as I like to say .
O,And we had lunch one day and it was really the craziest thing .
O,I mean it's a hard story to believe because we met for lunch .
O,We had a couple our lunch .
O,It was in the winter and it was I was at Soho House here in New York and we had lunch and it was crazy it was like we had the same exact idea and we were just completing each other's sentences .
O,And when I left lunch that day before I even got in my cab my cell phone rang and it was Elizabeth and she said to me . You know I'm going to look for real estate and you look at towels and I'll call you on Thursday .
O,And I thought wow like That's amazing .
O,I mean I still had a job and you know whatever .
O,And sure enough like she called me on Thursday and she said I found something on Craigslist .
O,She said it's twelve hundred square foot sublet of an old dance studio we could take a five year sublet and you should meet me tomorrow on seventy second street and I went and four months later we opened .
O,How are you doing on the towels she like .
O,So how are you doing on the towels .
O,So it's really interesting actually in case anybody wants to start a business .
O,It turns out that when you have a twelve hundred square foot studio and you don't actually have laundry facilities what you do is you rent towels and somebody picks them up and takes them away every day and launders them .
O,And I learned that on Google and I dutifully brought my towel report that day as she was signing the lease for our Craigslist dance studio .
O,You you based on just the reading that I've done in preparation for this made it some in retrospect would seem to be very important decisions .
O,One of them was deferring or minimizing payment to yourselves it seems .
O,And I read about maybe you could talk about the . I think it was what these every Sunday 200 dollars A.T.M. over there but
O,could you explain the rationale behind that . And could you elaborate on the the weekly ritual with the A.T.M. .
O,Definitely .
O,So when we started Soul Cycle I you know I actually like had a good job .
O,I was making real money and you know it was really the first time I actually that I ever thought about my time as money because I was sort of giving up a salary now and you know I was going to be using all my time but wasn't good necessarily be taking I took I took a small salary because at the time that's what we needed to do .
O,But my husband was working locally and he was supporting us but .
O,We had a five month old baby and we moved into a rent control apartment and we paid a little less than a thousand dollars a month .
O,We lived on 74 Street over Harry's burritos and I had a five month old baby who's in the front row .
O,She's not such a baby .
O,What are you wearing .
O,You guys .
O,And yeah so .
O,So what we decided was that we were you know we were going to make sacrifices so that we could start this business .
O,And .
O,Spencer My husband would go to the cash machine on Sunday nights and he would take out four hundred dollars .
O,We decided that when we started the business we were going to give our credit cards up and we were gonna put ourselves on like a real budget which we hadn't really done before .
O,We were two people with no kids and two salaries and you know we weren't making tons of money but we certainly had enough that we could each go to Starbucks and take cabs and go out for dinner and not think about a vacation .
O,And so Spencer would give us a white envelope each of us on Sunday nights .
O,We each got two hundred dollars and that was our money for the week .
O,And when the two hundred dollars was gone that was each of us . Meaning he got well he got two hundred bucks and I got two hundred bucks .
O,And I will tell you with a child in New York City two hundred dollars does not go that far .
O,So it was like you know a lot of strollers on the crosstown bus you know not a lot of Starbucks .
O,But that's what we did .
O,And you know it actually you know I think that one of the really interesting things about you know . Really believing in what you're doing and being so passionate about an idea and really believing that something should be born was it was hard .
O,And you know I remember clamping my finger in that stroller a million times and person on that bus but it didn't really feel like that big of a sacrifice .
O,I mean we were happy .
O,And we Elizabeth and I were were loving what we were doing and we did it .
O,And you know we lived in we lived in one room and you know when we wanted to watch TV we rolled the crib into our bedroom and we wanted to go to sleep it rolled the crib back out into the living room and that's what we did .
O,That was .
O,Thank you for painting a picture because I think it and you already said sort of anxious by by birth so it doesn't strike me as the perfect time to necessarily start a company and just with the 5 year old kid and five month year old kid .
O,So what they say and it's Sorry I for the Brits and the audience that's that's that's American as you speak it .
O,I think just highlights the fact that if if you really have something you want to do it feels important . There's very rarely going to be a perfect convenient time . To do it .
O,You know it was such a gift that it happened so quickly .
O,I talk a lot about Elizabeth my business partner sort of being a great entrepreneur and me being a really hard worker and I think that's part of what makes us such great partners .
O,Elizabeth an incredibly good risk taker .
O,I always say Elizabeth like a total baller and I'm just sort of running behind trying to work really hard .
O,But the truth is that I think because she was such a good risk taker because she's so good at moving the ball forward .
O,It all happened so quickly I didn't actually have time to be anxious or think oh I'm giving up my job and what's going to happen .
O,It was just like .
O,We met on Tuesday we saw the place on Thursday we went across the street to Starbucks we wrote on a napkin which you know we still have framed it says you know if we could see 100 people a day you know at twenty seven dollars a bike we're going to have enough money to pay for some babysitters .
O,We both had young kids at the time .
O,We're gonna be able to pay our studio staff .
O,We're gonna be able to take a little bit out of the business to justify the fact that we're not raising our own kids for the next decade .
O,And that was our business model on the back of that Starbucks napkin .
O,And the truth is it happened quickly and we just got into action mode so quick that we didn't have a lot of time to obsess about what if what if what if like we just had to make it happen every day .
O,What names . What other names were candidates for the business besides Soul Cycle .
O,Or was that just like a lightning bolt from the sky .
O,And that was it .
O,Did you guys .
O,That was a lightning bolt to Elisabeth's husband in the shower one day .
O,There was not a lightning bolt to either of us but you know we thought you know we thought of a bunch of different names
O,you know at the time again there was no boutique fitness in New York City and so we felt like we needed something sort of descriptive about the cycling part of it in the names .
O,We thought about cycle NYC you know we definitely had a lot of cycle in the name in the different other names because we felt we needed to be somewhat specific for people
O,and then he landed on Soul Cycle .
O,How did you decide on the business model and not just say the technology and the ambience and all these other elements that made it different but how did you how did you both think about developing the the business model .
O,So it's it's interesting .
O,I think that you know again at the time the landscape was . You know in New York City there were big box gyms .
O,And the model that was profitable was you went in you gave somebody your credit card .
O,They took an imprint of it and then they just hope that you never came because the best thing that could happen was that they could double or triple book your spot when they were figuring out their utilization and rather than take 400 members they could have 800 members or even better .
O,Both of those people didn't show up and they could have twelve hundred members and so for us you know we we really we really began to think about it in a different way .
O,And I think a lot of it you know has had to do also with with our idea that we were tasking ourselves to create a really special experience every time you know to the point of being a theater lover and thinking about things in terms of a production .
O,We used to always say that every time somebody crossed the threshold at Soul Cycle it was curtain up and until they left it was curtain down because we were only as good as their last experience
O,when we decided on a pay per class model . Everybody thought that we were crazy .
O,Like why wouldn't you just take people's credit cards .
O,Why wouldn't you just charge them and for us it was a challenge to everybody there from the people at the front desk to know your name to the instructor in that room to deliver a certain kind of experience to us to make sure that the brand was delivering a message and continuing to innovate .
O,And we just really felt like we wanted to challenge ourselves in that kind of way we wanted to deliver that kind of experience every time .
O,Were there any other early decisions that proved either particularly important slash good or particularly bad .
O,There were many decisions that now that proved that proved both of those things .
O,Let's talk about the good ones first .
O,I think that you know when we started Soul Cycle there were there were quite a few things that even though our business model on the Starbucks napkin might not seem as sophisticated .
O,I think that we were we were smarter than we thought that we were .
O,And we thought about a few different things .
O,We thought about technology .
O,We thought about the fact that at the time you had to go to the gym an hour early to put your name on a paper list and sign up for a class that was only going to be 45 minutes long .
O,So your gym experience now turned into two hours plus for 45 minutes worth of exercise and so we created the first online reservation system .
O,We thought about brand a lot .
O,We thought about creating something we never thought about soul cycle like we're creating a gym
O,you know for us our Muses were things like the white cube you know the art the art gallery in London or an Apple store .
O,We always thought about ourselves in a much different way and creating a brand and you know we never compared ourselves to fitness and we always thought sort of if we could create a brand if we could set a stage if we could create a place where people felt safe and empowered and like they could share with other people if we could set that stage and create that for people then they could have a different experience and they could have in an environment that . Wasn't like that .
O,We also really thought about community and we thought about you know how do we create a place where people support each other .
O,You know so much of what was going on at gyms was competition between people and for us it was all about you know some days I'm not going to feel like exercising but like if you can bring it for me on Monday and I can bring it for you on Wednesday and we can all raise each other up what is that kind of a place feel like yours is
O,as co participant .
O,Correct .
O,Correct .
O,And you know there were a lot of little decisions that we made along the way you know and things also that just happened to us in a lucky way
O,we started out with 35 bikes in the room we got popular before we could find a second space .
O,So we ended up with 45 bikes in the room and what did that do .
O,It put the bikes this close to each other .
O,And when people were done complaining about can you believe they're gonna charge twenty seven dollars and I'm gonna have to sit back close to somebody
O,what actually happened was the lights were dark and people could all feel the music at the same time and you could almost feel somebody's breathing next to you and your foot was on the same beat as their foot was on .
O,And all of a sudden it became connected and it became tribal and it was dark and there were candles and the music was amazing and an instructor is telling you that you could be more than you thought you could be .
O,And somehow the room is moving together in a way that you don't often feel connected to people like that even when you're having deep conversation there's something about a moving meditation with other people that are rooting for you that are holding space for you that aren't there to compete with you that are there to elevate you so that they can be elevated as well .
O,And when we created an experience like that it was magic .
O,I mean it was really magic .
O,And you know that is kind of was it was a really transformational thing for people .
O,It's really remarkable . Among other things that you two are still close in the sense that a lot of co-founders blow to smithereens at some point
O,like they get speed wobbles maybe because companies can't really quickly .
O,They might not have the important conversations up front that they should have .
O,There are a million and one reasons why a lot of these relationships don't work out .
O,I don't know if this factors in but could you talk to coaching or advisors and if if and how you've you've utilized . People to try to help you guys . Develop and maintain close bonds and ability to work together .
O,Definitely .
O,So early on in our business life Elizabeth and I started to see a coach and the way that that happened was we had a third business partner in the beginning and that was we quickly found out that you know that partnership was not necessarily going to work .
O,And we realized you know as that partnership was crumbling that it takes work to make good partnerships something that I have worked on my marriage something that you know is no longer a secret to me that people actually need skills and tools to be in relationships with other people .
O,You know there are plenty of people that are in relationships that are fine .
O,But if you really want to have great relationships that's actually a particular skill set right .
O,And so Elizabeth and picture I don't really know Elizabeth very well at this point .
O,I mean we're about a year into business .
O,You know we met at this lunch .
O,We decided like let's just go for it .
O,I mean you know we're still we're still pretty much strangers and you know Elizabeth you know while I was in L.A. growing a career Elizabeth Elizabeth's in Colorado .
O,She goes to University of Boulder .
O,She spends her time in Telluride .
O,She is like a much more sort of evolved spiritual you know at peace with the world person than I am
O,I'm still like I've only lived on the coasts you know I've only democratized .
O,So Elizabeth calls me in the middle of the night and she says you know I've googled life coach NYC
O,I've realized she's having a nervous breakdown because she realizes that our business is taking off our third partner is walked .
O,You know we've got to get rid of our third partner who's completely toxic and now it's like what's going to happen here .
O,And we both have little kids at home and you know the worst thing that's happening is that our business is becoming such a success that like we're going to have to you know put our foot on the gas here .
O,And so she says she's she's googled life coach NYC and then I should meet her tomorrow at somewhere some location around Gramercy because we're going to meet with the coach and I'm thinking I hang up the phone I say to my husband like this woman is batshit crazy like there is no way like I have to work tomorrow Oh there's no way I'm getting myself in a cab going all the way downtown to go to some hotel and sit with some life coach NYC like I'm thinking we're sitting with Dionne Warwick and she is going to tell us you know .
O,But sure enough I mean we get there and you know we start to talk to our coach who by the way we still work with today .
O,We I don't .
O,There are so many decisions in my life and our life that we wouldn't make without her .
O,And I met with a woman .
O,Her name is Meredith Tabor field she has an incredible company called think human .
O,And we started to talk about you know what it what it's like to be good partners and you know what it takes to make decisions together and like any relationship you know you're two people that have a common vision but are in very different moments in your life at all times in a business relationship is no different .
O,I mean there are times that like I need money and you don't or you know I I need to slow down for a minute because something's going on in the life of my family and you want to put your foot on the gas or whatever and or there's just things that you want to do with the business .
O,I'm ready to sell the business and you're not you know how does what does that all look like and and everything along the way from learning how to be the only two employees in a company to managing twenty five hundred employees and what do you look like as leaders and how do you communicate with your employees and so we started down this journey with Meredith our therapist coach life coach NYC I really think she's changed her website since then .
O,You know we've we've we've worked with her for a long time now 10 years and I will I will say that she taught us lessons that helped inform the entire way that the culture of our company would exist .
O,You know we would learn how to have a conversation with each other and then we would take those skills and we would codify them we had an incredible Chief Culture Officer and we'd work on them we'd learn have those skills and then we'd bring her in to learn that skill and then we'd codify it and we would teach the entire organization how to communicate like that .
O,And we did that until we created a really extensive library of tools that we use to build a culture .
O,And what was amazing was and you know I know that you speak to so many founders that have spoken business instead of started businesses .
O,But I really do believe that you know just like the way that I was saying to you like the nuances of people what makes them special or just just so intricate and so interesting .
O,I really think that the nuances of great businesses come from the DNA of their founders .
O,You know it's those very things that make those people special that ultimately make those companies so special .
O,But the problem is right after it goes from two employees to two thousand employees .
O,How do you take that DNA and keep it in a place that's really what it was meant to be .
O,And I will say that finding that coach was so lucky not only for me personally I can honestly say that it is has changed who I am as a human being and who I ever would have been able to be as a leader .
O,But it also allowed us to scale this kind of stuff into our culture which was incredible for our employees .
O,I mean we gave them tools like you know how to get unstuck which was really just teaching them how to have a conversation about what was bothering them and to create spaces where they could have those conversations and not feel like people were going to judge them or you know reward them or punish them for what they were saying you know
O,we had an expression sort of you know saying no lumpy carpets we created a you know an ethos where it was you know you had to communicate with your co-worker if something was bothering you .
O,And we created a space where you could have those conversations and we taught people not only how to express themselves but also how to listen
O,OK .
O,There's so much to unpack .
O,Let's let's get let's get into it .
O,So the . Tools that you developed or were able to learn from your coach are one set of questions that I'll get to .
O,But let me start with going from oh my God we're gonna be talking to a psychic .
O,Get me out here .
O,I'm busy working with someone for 10 years .
O,Were you sold in the first meeting .
O,And if so why .
O,What did she do not do ask not ask exude that that sold you
O,well here here was what was so interesting about you know our meeting .
O,I mean first of all it was definitely one of those lean in moments .
O,You know I had never really met somebody who had such different life experience than me and was so different than me and yet saw it all the same .
O,Elizabeth and I have such completely different things that we bring to our partnership and relationship .
O,And yet at the end of the day we have a really common vision .
O,And .
O,I think that that's really that that's really what drew me to her .
O,And in the case of Meredith specifically how did she overcome your skepticism about that use of time .
O,Well first of all she's just completely cool and normal .
O,Like if she was here with us she would just be you know us .
O,You know she's she's super .
O,She's just she's just .
O,And she's just real you know there's there's no bullshit .
O,It's like she will call you on it and she asks you really hard questions .
O,You know you'll sit there and defend something for 15 minutes .
O,Well that's not how I see it .
O,And that's not how I want it .
O,And .
O,Yeah .
O,But that's the idea .
O,And then she'll say to you that's all great .
O,Here's what I want you to think about .
O,And you don't have to answer it now .
O,She'll say to you something like this
O,at the end of your life . When you look back on this who do you want to have been .
O,How do you want people to have thought of you .
O,And they'll just go wow because that's some different shit than what I was about defending right now .
O,Right .
O,Well that's way different than being right in this room right now .
O,You know when I think back to the end of my life and I think back about the way that I want people to have thought of me or have listened to people or taken a moment to considered somebody else's feelings or point of view or put myself in their shoes I mean that's some different stuff than being right in the moment .
O,And you know when somebody asks you a question like that you know you stop and it's always questions like that .
O,Or or it's questions and a lot of times it's just you and yourself and she'll just ask you questions like you know about why you're doing things you know is it about your ego is it about the way other people think about you .
O,Is it because you need more money .
O,You know questions that you I don't know .
O,I have not done enough work on myself to ask to really ask myself those questions I'm really good still at talking myself into the things that I want to hear .
O,And when you were talking about the getting unstuck if I'm getting that right or and no lumpy carpets or no lumps in the carpet on my began the freezing rug .
O,Or managing these what could be very uncomfortable conversations with a partner about wanting to sell when someone else doesn't want to sell whatever the conversation might be or
O,it seems like a lot of those tools and whether it's for employees or for the two of you is about having uncomfortable conversations successfully and managing conflict .
O,Are there any specific recommendations .
O,Tools anything at all or examples you could give of how to approach say . The the employee who has something that is bothering them about a coworker kind of walking them through how to do that in a way that doesn't lead to World War Three .
O,Well you know first of all I think that .
O,You know for better or for worse I think that you know company culture also has a lot to do with it .
O,I think that creating environments where it's safe for people to do those things .
O,You know there's so there's so much politicking and you know things that still go on in many places where you know that sort of you know .
O,You have to actually reward that behavior .
O,You know I do think that that is something that is you know it has to be considered .
O,But what I will say is that you know I do think that having those conversations and beginning to have those conversations really start with teaching people how to listen first .
O,You know I think that training people how to to listen to what somebody else has to say allows people who then have issues to go out and be heard .
O,I will tell you about something actually great that my husband and I have done for a long time which actually changed the dynamic of our relationship .
O,And I can honestly say that it's you know if I ever had to say sort of the other best thing that I've ever done is you know we had our first daughter and all of a sudden we were no longer two people that could just do what they wanted whenever they wanted .
O,You know if we both wanted to go to take different exercise classes at different gyms at the same time .
O,Well somebody had to stay home with our kid and that began to create conflict .
O,You know we no longer had the time that we used to have to ourselves .
O,We no longer had the autonomy it's you know it's different .
O,You know when you're when you have a child and so you know we had we'd started arguing and we had started you know having all this conflict .
O,And my husband who happens to be a much more evolved person than I am in a much better communicator said you know well maybe you should go talk to somebody and we started to go to some couples counseling and see different marital people you know want to hunt for some solution to this
O,and you know when we were in the room with couples counselors and therapists we know we would basically were to like really smart people so we would just play the women the therapist game
O,you know so we'd Swedes if we'd spent a couple of hundred bucks an hour trying to figure out who was going to actually win that day
O,and then finally you know we quit the couples therapy and because that is our therapist liked him better .
O,And and then finally you know Spencer was seeing a therapist on his own and she said she had given him a suggestion and she said you know you should read this book and it's called getting the love that you want .
O,And he brought it home one day and he started to read it and he would say to me like you've got to read this this book is really amazing .
O,And before he was through the book he had gone out and bought a copy for me and said like we should read this together .
O,And so we started to read this book and before we were done with the book we had actually signed up for the workshop and I bring this up because this is actually a technique that we have learned that you can use with your employees you can use with your children you can kind of use with anybody but we went to this workshop
O,it was probably the most important 40 hours of our of our marriage up until that point and it is these two older therapists called Harvard Hendrix and Helen Hunt .
O,And here's what's so fascinating
O,they Carville was the first person to an Oprah daytime Emmy .
O,He is this amazing older therapist who had studied relationships for a long time and was becoming very prominent and his wife was also a research professor that was studying relationships in the brain .
O,And she's she's learning all these things about the brain and cortisol levels and he's winning daytime Emmys and they're both on their second marriages and they're actually about to get divorced while they're all winning all these awards and stuff
O,and you go and take the seminar and cut to this 50 percent of first marriages end up in divorce 70 percent of second marriages end up in divorce and about 90 percent of third marriages do
O,teaching you that it has not much to do with the partner that you choose but mostly the skillset that you bring to the relationship .
O,Right .
O,And so here's the crazy thing you know nobody teaches us how to be married .
O,Nobody teaches us how to communicate with a partner or nobody teaches us how to communicate with anybody .
O,You know I don't remember being in a class in school where somebody said to me you know this is how you listen this is how you talk to somebody this is how you consider what they're saying
O,and really all you do in this workshop is you learn active listening .
O,You know we learned how to make appointments with each other and have conversations so that you're not bombarding somebody at a time where they can't hear you
O,when you make an appointment and you say it's your turn to talk . Basically you know I say you know I say what I need to say and then all that person gets to do is repeat back to you and say Is there more .
O,That's it that's all the person gets to do .
O,And then you with you know there always is more .
O,It's never really just about that is it .
O,Right .
O,And then you say what more there is and then they get to repeat it back and then they get to say is there more .
O,And you know what happens at the end of three is they're wars rather than trying to win the therapist and rather than trying to be right .
O,What you realize is that somebody is suffering about something and then it's coming from a source of pain not coming from a source of like you .
O,And it's not about you being right .
O,It's about taking care of somebody that you love or taking care of somebody that you work with or hearing a child that's coming home from a school that didn't have a good day or got a bad grade that's feeling disappointed also .
O,And I think really you know teaching people how to listen and how to have conversations is something that's so important .
O,Thank you very specific .
O,Are there other examples of ways you've brought things from that workshop or book or elsewhere into your relationships .
O,Aside from the specific examples you just gave in terms of active listening are there any other tools or habits that you've . Adopted or found useful .
O,There are actually many others .
O,I think that one is really the one that it's really the focus of the workshop and what you do . You know more most often but there are a lot of amazing practices
O,you know telling people what's great about them .
O,I mean how often do you you know do you think about something that's wonderful about your partner and make sure that you share that every day .
O,How often do you make time to be proactive about doing something nice again whether it's for a spouse whether it's for a child whether it's for a colleague .
O,I think there are a lot of incredible things that happen out of that workshop .
O,But I will say that you know the foundation of it is really learning to listen .
O,You have in you mentioned that I think and I'm paraphrasing here so correct me if I'm wrong here but the you see founders with certain DNA certain superpowers and that sort of infuses and informs the organization .
O,And I think it's at least been my experience observing and being involved a lot of companies that also if there is acute dysfunction in a founder that can also sort of infuse its way into a company .
O,So you're mentioning that just to say that the the culture which we take to be like a shared set of beliefs and behaviors leads us how I think of it does not just take care of itself .
O,And part of that is doing the work that that you guys have done as founders both separately and together up .
O,Are there any other whether it's books seminars advisors anything that come to mind as having made a real difference whether it's in your business life or in your personal life that you're like . You know what I would recommend .
O,I've tried a lot of things here a few things .
O,I would definitely recommend that people check out
O,yeah I mean a big a big book at Soul Cycle for us was always start with Y from Simon Sinek and I know that's made it to a lot of your lists and a lot of people are Simon Sinek fans but but I will say and you know this is what I think is so interesting .
O,You know as somebody who is fascinated with brand and you know the articulation of brand and all things brand I think that people are often confused and think of brand as the way something looks or the color of a logo .
O,But you know brands are really how people feel
O,they're really you know I think it was maybe Jeff Bezos who said it's what people say about you when you're not in the room or you know that kind of a thing .
O,And I do think that you know start with why is so important because people understanding you know why you do something not what you are doing is really what what makes or breaks a brand .
O,And I think everything about that book is fantastic .
O,I think that you know for us really we spent so much time .
O,You know I remember the day that we just really officially stopped doing our day jobs .
O,I looked at Elizabeth and said like are we ever gonna get to go back to work or do we have to spend our whole life making these people happy you know referring to our employees .
O,And that was the truth .
O,But there was a day where you know it all turned and you began to realize that if the culture wasn't gonna be good that the product wasn't gonna be good and I think that's like a real you know core value from Simon Sinek who really says that you're happy happiest customer is only as happy as your happiest employee .
O,And so for us like really making sure that our employees were taken care of and and taken care of meaning you know not just financially but really felt like they mattered like the things that they were doing or moving the needle for the company that we personally understood .
O,You know things that they were going through achievements that that they were you know making happen .
O,I think that really taking care of employees in a way that they feel heard is very important .
O,What were little things or big things that you did to foster those things to make those things happen .
O,So I mean interestingly enough one of one of the main things that we recognized in the beginning when we started Soul Cycle was that the fitness industry in general was really broken .
O,Instructors didn't have full time jobs anywhere so if you are a fitness professional you would teach two classes at one gym and three classes at another gym and personal trainer somebody in their home .
O,So you'd spend your entire life sort of you know commuting and being exhausted just to try to cobble together a living and then on top of it for doing one of the most physical jobs in the world . You had no health insurance you had no paid vacation and you know you certainly had no place to call home or really feel like you had somebody or to support you or that cared about you .
O,And one thing that was very early on a goal for us was to create these careers for fitness instructors which is something that we really did
O,and you know we .
O,You know we paid more .
O,We gave people full health benefits we paid for those vacations and you know most importantly we really gave them a home .
O,You know we built a platform you know Soul Cycle was really a platform that we built to allow you know we really thought you know our fitness instructors as artists for allow artists to really find their voice on a platform and to sort of give them the room to be creative and to grow into being their best selves .
O,And I think by giving people that kind of a platform and room and then really taking care of them in kind of the tactical aspects of their lives it allowed people to become a different kind of employee .
O,I mean what we found was that we didn't have employees what we had was Brandon masters you know we had people walking around so proud that they worked at Soul Cycle telling everybody how fantastic it was
O,you know it became way more like a family than it did a job .
O,So I'm gonna ask questions about good strategic decisions and we're definitely going to get to
O,you see how I've avoided the failures right .
O,Yes .
O,Yes .
O,Now we're gonna get to the waste of time and money because there are plenty of those stories in all businesses initiatives that didn't go quite as hoped but one story that I read was related to opening the Bridge Hampton location .
O,And how you sort of resisted the urge to pay yourselves or pay yourself much .
O,And as I understand also had not taken outside investment so I would imagine especially being a New York City as soon as something seems to be going really well and spreading quite widely that you start getting calls you start getting emails about outside investment .
O,So could you talk to why or how you decided when to take outside investment which could just be why you didn't take it up to this point and then the . The thinking behind the bridge chapter location which for people who everybody in this room or a lot of people I'm sure know where Bridge Hampton is but for those people in the wider world so you have Manhattan and then you have long island and you go way out and have this place called the Hamptons and depending on who you are there's very little in the middle either you love or you hate the Hamptons
O,I happen to grow up as a townie out there so I have this incredible inner conflict that I bounce back and forth between the two and just two four people who do not know .
O,So the Hamptons are kind of the where many of these successful people from Manhattan go to summer beautiful beaches where for some people they go to be seen .
O,Why why were chipped and how do you guys think about it and why do outside investment .
O,Well let me just say that you know again to the point of ignorance is bliss . We opened in four months .
O,You know when I look back now and when I think about all the investing that we've done and when I think about how the world is spinning with people raising money I really think that it was an incredible luxury to have no investors .
O,I mean we were really allowed to make decisions that were just the best for the business .
O,We always just used our gut instincts .
O,And you know there was no choice except doing what was right for our customers what was right for employees and really what was right for Soul Cycle .
O,I mean we invented a brand that was like a human being you know and we would always make choices if you know we have four daughters and between us .
O,But you know Soul Cycle was like our fifth daughter and we would always you know really make choices thinking about you know what is the right choice for this business and .
O,Not having money in the beginning . I also think really informed the way that we it .
O,You know we had no marketing dollars .
O,I mean zero up until 10 years into the business . We didn't spend any money on advertising .
O,And I think what it really did was it really forced us to be incredibly disciplined and incredibly scrappy and really be a part of the immunities that we were trying to create .
O,You know we would be out there you know at the mouth of Central Park handing out flyers and in the bike loop I'd be pushing my stroller up and down Broadway trying to get doormen to let me in to mail room buildings so that I could leave flyers .
O,You know if you could actually find our studio which by the way was in the rear lobby of a building with no sign on the outside of it .
O,We forgot to talk about that .
O,We'll get to that in the epic failures .
O,But you know we would . We were so happy to see you that we would do anything .
O,I mean I would watch your dog I'd feed your parking meter .
O,I'd let your kids sit there and you know play a video game like it didn't matter like we needed you to like your experience because we had zero money for marketing and at the time trying to convince somebody to come to the back lobby of an office building . Actually that went to the mortuary to to do that to convince you to pay twenty seven dollars to click into a bike to be in a dark room for 45 minutes
O,I mean if we could get you there like you had to come it was enough and we weren't doing to get you come back .
O,But all that being said it really was interesting because you know when I think about the way that we thought about that first studio and I think about that napkin that we wrote our hundred riders on .
O,You know I think about starting a business and I think about this for a lot of young entrepreneurs and there is so much low hanging fruit in the beginning .
O,I mean we really thought about building that first studio rider by rider
O,and you know people will say to me Did you ever think Soul Cycle was gonna be such a big deal did you ever think this was gonna happen .
O,And what I always thought to myself was .
O,I just knew that I needed a hundred people there
O,and that was not going to be a problem for me because if I had to go and walk up and down the streets of Manhattan and call my friends and get people on those bikes like 100 people are coming today .
O,And that was what I thought about it and I think that that really forced us to have a different kind of discipline than if we had had crazy investment and marketing dollars and you know it just it just shaped who we were and the way that we understood our customer because we were in it in a different kind of way .
O,And there was a lot of freedom to that .
O,And the great news for us was that you know our business model was great .
O,I mean we kept throw more and more bikes in that room and it was teeny little place .
O,I mean twelve hundred square feet .
O,We ended up we had 40 something bikes in there twenty seven dollars a bike oh and eight times a day .
O,You know we were able to sort of create our first you know four or five six studios you know taking from Peter giving to Paul selling to Mary .
O,You know it was like it was pretty great .
O,I mean we were really able to finance one with the other and because we were not taking money out of the business because we really were that disciplined we were taking everything that we made and we were putting it back into the business and we were growing organically and again to the same point of not noticing the Starbucks was missing from my life and taking the taxis we were having a great time .
O,And it really didn't feel like we were suffering
O,so I'm gonna I'm going to end there I may be kind of chasing chasing the wrong trail in terms of Bridge Hampton but so we can say no no we can scrap it maybe
O,but I want to highlight something that's really important that's come up numerous times with founders of companies that have done extremely well on a large scale is that .
O,In most cases especially if the business models actually work .
O,I mean there are some companies they get very big with this is also work but in the case of the electoral cycle .
O,It .
O,It's very tempting to want to say that you're aiming for this billion dollar two billion dollar X billion dollar outcome but it is as Seth Godin has said on the podcast before .
O,It's very easy to hide when you have this grandiose somewhat abstract gigantic goal .
O,And so he's like start small because you have nowhere to hide .
O,It's like a hundred people .
O,It's a very clear measurable outcome and with no marketing dollars is also a common thread that I see with a lot of these companies that are at least those I've been exposed to there that are kind of consumer facing is if you don't have much in terms of marketing dollars or you constrain it deliberately you have to make sure your product is great .
O,Thank you .
O,You really have to ensure that your product or service is really really good and then your customers become your marketing .
O,Well that's that's that was always the philosophy right .
O,I mean we always knew .
O,And again this was part of it kind of all work together right because we created a pay per class model .
O,It had to be great every time or else nobody had to come back
O,and what we used to say was like it can't just be good
O,like this cannot be a utility
O,like this needs to be so good that people are talking about it when they're out with their friends on Saturday night for dinner and they are wanting you know you want the credit for finding the coolest greatest thing that's going to make your friend feel the best and you're gonna bring that person .
O,And so the saying in the halls of Soul Cycle would be like we do not create users we create evangelists you know and our evangelists were spreading the gospel for us and that's really was our marketing .
O,But I will answer your question about Bridge Hampton .
O,We were we were doing very well .
O,And we had become this little Upper West Side destination and the studio was bustling and we were selling our classes really well and we realized pretty soon everybody was going to leave for the summer because that's what happens in New York right .
O,There's a mass exodus to different beaches and whether you know people are going to the Hamptons or the Jersey Shore or wherever they're going .
O,There's nobody here on the weekends in the summer .
O,And so I called Hamptons magazine to see what it would be to take you know an ad I thought oh we'll just take an ad in the Fourth of July you know publication and they gave me like a staggering quote and I thought Well we certainly don't have that much money and the truth is you know what we did was experiential
O,you know I could sit here and tell you how awesome it is to be on a bike and what it feels like in the music and the sweat the instructors and the people and then you're sort of like you still can't really feel it because you know there's no music playing and we're not in the dark .
O,And what I found was the only real way to get people to calm and to really experience it was to come and get them to take a class .
O,And so we comp a lot of classes we tell people they didn't like it they should pay it and like it give them their money back .
O,But I realized that doing something experiential would be better than taking an ad
O,and we got a phone call one day and somebody said there's this great old potato barn and there used to be some pole dancing class in there and the pole dancing class was apparently going out of business and not the space would be vacant if we want to create a cycling studio .
O,And so we figured you know we could either spend seventy five thousand dollars running a quarter page ad in Hamptons magazine or we could just run the studio and plan on making no money and just think of it as a marketing experiment I mean that's all we thought it was going to be was marketing dollars .
O,And so we did .
O,And we you know we we went and we we painted the barn and we rolled our bikes in there and we put a big yellow wheel on the wall and we flung open our doors and the barn became like a sensation .
O,It really became you know I know we were we live in a little bit of a Soul Cycle bubble but it really is like I mean it's really the epicenter of you know Hamptons social life you know people will tell you that you know if they can go and you know take a class at the barn it's all cycle in the morning and then sort of you know how you know hobnob in between classes they barely need to go out at night anymore because that barn sees hundreds and hundreds of people between the hours of 7 and 12:00 on a Saturday morning .
O,And it really it what it did for us was it took our little Upper West Side business from being a local kind of great neighborhood business hundred people a day to all of a sudden becoming this sort of buzz worthy New York City on page six in the New York Times you know destination .
O,And we came back from that summer .
O,And what happened on Monday is at noon which is when our reservation system opens so if you want to reserve a bike at Soul Cycle you go on Monday at noon if you have a specific thing that you'd like to reserve and you can sign up for your classes for the full week .
O,And what happened for us when we came back that that fall was that we started to crash servers at noon on Monday .
O,The the demand load became crazy and all of a sudden we noticed like a lap a line of town cars up and down the street will always be parked outside for Soul Cycle classes .
O,There was no Uber yet at the time .
O,And what it was is that people were coming from all over now you know waiting and their drivers or whoever or whatever rides they were taken up there would be waiting outside .
O,And it became you know that's when we knew like we needed to grow .
O,No the other studio except . The market doesn't want us to grow .
O,You know it's 2007 and everybody wants a Chase bank or a Duane Reade in their space
O,you know two women with a business that is throwing off a bunch of cash still does not look that attractive .
O,OK so how do you how do you solve that problem .
O,Well when 2008 happens you wake up suddenly cash is king .
O,No no .
O,You know it still was not easy .
O,But 2008 happened and it definitely became you know easier for us to think about getting space .
O,After we you know we started to well we .
O,OK .
O,So now let's talk about you know when we actually did take money because there did come a point after about four years where we we took money we had eight studios .
O,And it's interesting our decision to take money was not so much about the money itself .
O,But again we really loved what we were doing .
O,We could really see how Soul Cycle was changing neighborhoods .
O,And it was changing communities and it was changing the way that people felt about themselves and about .
O,Other people .
O,And we wanted to win .
O,You know we had a first mover advantage and we were starting to see copycats come into the landscape and we were introduced to Equinox to Harvey Spivak who's the CEO of Equinox and we started to get to know him .
O,And you know the money and the cash infusion seemed nice although you know we did pretty good business .
O,I mean the businesses were making money and we could have expanded in a slower way but we thought to ourselves that you know we would take a strategic partner rather than just taking money and they would be able to help us you know grow 30 studio 15 and 15 20 30 studios at a time rather than let's say five or six or seven a year .
O,What were some of the decisions or initiatives or anything where you look back and you're like Well that was a bad use of time or money .
O,Any anything come to mind .
O,Mm hmm .
O,There were just .
O,Or just Yeah we should have thought about that differently .
O,Well there are definitely a few .
O,I mean we definitely made a lot of mistakes along the way .
O,Neither of us had ever been entrepreneurs before and there were small mistakes and there were definitely bigger mistakes .
O,You know Elizabeth always likes to say you know every time we would make a mistake and be fifty thousand dollars . We didn't have and she would say well look at it this way you know neither of us went to business school it's like part of our tuition for our MBA .
O,Yeah .
O,And that was that was always true .
O,But you know we started out in our first studio and what did we know we didn't never built anything before .
O,And we we built a studio and some guy told us that he was really good at soundproofing things and he'd done some porn studios in Midtown and so we thought great .
O,Like this guy's done porn studios go to it and he stuffs it insulation into the ceilings and closed him off and then you know cut to opening day we turn on the stereo to find like a line of irate neighbors outside of our door and we certainly did not have money to re soundproof the studio .
O,And so that was you know that was really interesting a whole lot .
O,Sure it was interesting .
O,Fade to black .
O,So what would you do .
O,Well now we're again you know I find that if you can befriend you know local neighborhood law enforcers sometimes .
O,They will soundproof .
O,They will come and do the sound checks for your studio later in the evening when there may or may not be actual classes going on .
O,And then you might actually be able to make the sound a little bit lower than you do during regular classes sometimes extra time that worked for us for a while until we had money to reset for the studio .
O,Yeah well you have to sometimes have to build the bridges or crossing it .
O,Yes .
O,And we built some of those .
O,Another fantastic memory was our first customer appreciation day .
O,This one this is really like one of my favorite I can talk about study in human behavior .
O,So we decided after about a year we really wanted to thank the people that had helped us build business .
O,And so what we were going to do was an entire day of free classes on Saturday starting 7:00 o'clock in the morning all day long .
O,We were so excited about it I mean for us giving up a Saturday of revenue was huge .
O,I mean Saturday was our biggest day we had for those a month .
O,I mean we were still living by the skin of our teeth .
O,We are still going you know .
O,So we we decided we were going to let everybody just call the studio rather than use the reservation system and sign up for free .
O,We were going to do you know big bowls of fruit and free drinks and juice sponsorships and all this great stuff cut to we like open up the phone lines and of course a million people that don't ever come to Soul Cycle sign up for the free classes
O,and now all of our regulars are irate because they actually don't give a shit if they have to pay for class .
O,They just want to be on the bike .
O,They want to be on with the instructor at the time that they want to be on .
O,And now what we have is hundreds of pissed off customers who cannot get into a Saturday class at Soul Cycle and hundreds of people that may or may not actually show up but just signed up for a free class because I put it in time out and that was our first customer appreciation day .
O,So that was a great learning exercise .
O,I would say the worst amount of money we ever spent was you know scrappy entrepreneurs no funding how Elizabeth worked on all of our technology with a web developer in Long Island .
O,You know they built everything you know as it came up .
O,So you know first we built it for one studio and then we built it for 10 Studios and then we wanted to have AECOM and you know until we built this thing that was basically like building a million extensions onto a foundation of a house that couldn't handle it .
O,And so we needed to rebuild our Web site .
O,And so we were psyched .
O,I mean we had a million dollars to spend and we were going to hire the pros and that's what we did .
O,We went out and we hired a big fancy agency and we worked on you know articulating our vision and our brand and we spent six months explaining to somebody else what we already knew which was you know our brand and our experience and the user experience and things that were kind of already working on that Web site
O,and then was going to be the big reveal or big fancy new Web site and I don't know I mean they they they gave us a new you know a new CTO that was checking all of the hardware and software and all the things that we were launching but somehow we flipped on the switch that day and flipped off the other website and it was great because eight people could book the same bike in the same class at the same time .
O,And that was a disaster .
O,And then to make it even better nobody could fix it .
O,One week of sign ups one by four weeks of sign ups one by six weeks of sign ups .
O,I talk about using up your goodwill in
O,the first two weeks . People gave us the benefit of the doubt .
O,We had great customer service teams people showed up .
O,They gave people hugs they gave people free classes or thought I'd get off of the hugs .
O,Yeah it was like bye bye week number four . People were just like we were just .
O,They just thought we were totally inept .
O,I mean that's actually how our app was born to divert people from our fancy new Web site that never actually got working .
O,I mean it works now but it took us quite a while .
O,I mean we were able to build an app better than we were able to fix that site .
O,That sounds really stressful .
O,It was stressful .
O,So I don't know if this is still a thing and maybe it was never a thing and it's just something somebody wrote on the Internet 16 seconds to call .
O,That's how long I can meditate .
O,Okay .
O,Could you talk about any other any other that and any other tools that might help when you're going through an experience like that
O,so I'm not really good at sitting still .
O,That's not my specialty .
O,I have definitely tried meditation and many different forms with many very talented people and many trusted friends have referred me to many places that I I'm sure are the right places to be meditating and I have never found it yet in my being to meditate .
O,I think that's why Soul Cycle continues to be such a huge part of my life .
O,Just because there is something in that room for me that is really meditative and to the point of coping skills it's still something that's in my you know daily practice almost you know at least a couple of times a week .
O,But for me I have a friend who started a meditation studio in Los Angeles and sent me you know a million ways to get onto her app and her staff and there is one meditation that I have found that is called 16 seconds to calm
O,and it's 16 seconds and you basically take one breath in one breath out .
O,But this guy tells you why you're interrupting patterns while you do that because you're focusing on your breath .
O,And he claims that in your in those 16 seconds you have interrupted your thought patterns enough that you've broken the cycle of anxiety and I choose to believe it .
O,So this is .
O,Besides the 16 seconds .
O,And aside from Soul Cycle Are there other tools habits routines anything at all that you've found to help you to operate at a high level when there's the potential to be overwhelmed by stress .
O,I mean you know like you said you don't strike me as the type to sit still for very long .
O,Seem to do a lot and get a lot done .
O,And therein lies the risk I think overwhelmed .
O,So what are other things you do to avoid buckling under . Overwhelmed .
O,I will honestly say that the number one thing that keeps me from buckling under is that I have a really awesome marriage .
O,I know that that sounds funny or or maybe not but I have chosen a partner who actually is really amazing at communicating with me during times of anxiety and actually has sort of created an atmosphere in our home that is not super tolerant of my anxiety in the best way possible .
O,So what is the best way does that look like .
O,It looks like it looks like you know when I walk through the threshold of my house you know I have a partner that if I'm stressed out sort of demands me to communicate about it and sort of get rid of it .
O,And you know we have a lot of respect for each other and he usually finds a way to to figure out what it is that can can bring me down from that and I will say that being in a relationship like that with somebody who is not an anxious person who is able to kind of de-escalate your own anxiety is just kind of fantastic .
O,Could you give an example you don't have to but if you can of language is so important you write like the devil's really in the details so what might he say or ask when he's like code red .
O,I see what's coming and wants to . Get you to talk about it or de-escalate what might be
O,like just this morning .
O,We were preparing for this interview and I said to like you can help me with the questions for him .
O,And he said to me you know I didn't want to say this to you yesterday but you said that to me the same way yesterday and you were asking it to me in a way that obviously you're very anxious and you know of course I want to help you but would you like to ask that in a different way .
O,And I thought to myself you know I know he wants to help me because he is like the biggest supporter of my whole entire life and I'm sure that he and I know that he spent a lot of time thinking about this because he sent me emails you know that I asked him thing about this and then I thought for a second about my own anxiety and where I was going with it because I thought you know oh I have something else to do at 11:00 and if he can help me at ten thirty .
O,It was my own crazy person in there thinking like you need to help me right now .
O,That was like my own person .
O,But he does not get worked up like that .
O,And so he said to me like do you want to ask me differently because you asked me the same way yesterday and I don't think .
O,And the thing was that was just in my own check and most of the times that I you know am communicating badly with him with my children it's because I'm in a state of anxiety or distress .
O,And I think having somebody like that by your side that can check you like that again in a way that's loving not in a way that's you know . Like that I think that really helps to to bring the situation down and I will tell you one other amazing thing that we do in our house that has really helped to kind of reframe the way that we we live .
O,So we started to celebrate Shabbat about five years ago .
O,I was out one day with a friend of mine who is like a super successful music executive .
O,She's like definitely one of my main girl crushes you know .
O,She's like a total boss and a real power broker and we were having a business lunch one day and at the end of the lunch she said to me you know I have to duck out a few minutes early I have to go pick up a holla for Shabbat a holler for people who don't celebrate Shabbat is the braided bread that we eat on Shabbat right .
O,And you know one thing that you know my business partner Elizabeth loves . She always says to me it's always fun to find out something new that you don't know about somebody that you think you know really well .
O,So I looked at my friend Julie and I said Really .
O,I said you like celebrate Chipotle on Friday night .
O,She said Yeah you know I'm out a couple nights of the week listening to music and I find that you know because I'm so busy it's really it's a lot of integrity for our family .
O,You know we all have to be at the dinner table at six thirty on Friday night and we put our phones away and we light candles and we don't take out our phones so the next morning and it's the one thing that we do in our house that really you know reframes our time together
O,and I thought well she's clearly more important than I am and she makes this so like I could definitely fit Shabbat in and we started to have Shabbat .
O,And here's the interesting thing .
O,You know we're not religious people I would say that we are we're spiritual just in the way that we believe that you know the way that you are in the world is the way that you feel in the world and I think that we believe in something bigger and that we're all connected in some way .
O,But I wouldn't say that we're religious
O,but we started to have Shabbat and we have very few requirements of our children . But one requirement is that everybody is home for that evening .
O,Our daughter who was five months old when we started Soul Cycle she's now 13 and our rule for her is she can have as many friends as she wants but she has to be there
O,and we let our candles at six thirty .
O,And there's something about the time that it takes those candles to burn that for me who cannot meditate . Being with people that I love and there's always plenty of people at our table it's friends or family and it's always fantastic and there is just something about the time that it takes those candles to burn and not having phones and having a different kind of conversation with each other and just it's almost like I've given myself permission for the evening to shut down
O,and whatever that is inside of me that has . Whenever the minute we light the candles says like it's cool till tomorrow the world's going to wait for you .
O,There is something about that ritual for me that's really one of the times that I look forward to most in the week .
O,What .
O,What rules do you have during Shabbat and does it . Is it primarily . And what's the duration is this is primarily from the dinner to the following morning and you guys all put phones away .
O,Is that is that the most important rule or are there other rules so you guys follow .
O,Now we say you know we say we'd like candles and we do say two prayers in Hebrew .
O,It's what we do .
O,My husband has recently started playing the guitar and he's he's mastering some guitar songs .
O,And so we usually we try to have some music .
O,He's getting pretty good .
O,Our kids are usually super embarrassed if they're friends over their dad's Mukhtar and their mom's singing and clapping .
O,So it's a really big hit .
O,I tried to buy a lot of really good desserts .
O,You know everything from within bakery to big by Melissa on down to lower . My kids are at sticker around the table for a certain amount of time .
O,Spencer and I try to keep our phones in the drawer until the following morning my daughter you know what . Obviously die without getting back on Snapchat by about 9 o'clock .
O,So we allow her to do that .
O,And there are no rules really .
O,And the crazy thing is you know it's just again it's it's always intimate .
O,It always feels like a safe space that always feels like people can share like what really happened to them that week .
O,You know how they're really feeling about themselves their triumphs their tragedies .
O,It just feels like there's like no bullshit at the table .
O,You know people are really for for all the times during the week that you had to go out and pretend it was great or that you were killing it at work or that I loved you at school today or whatever it is it just feels like it's a really kind of you know we all go well you know we go in pajamas or sweat pants you know no matter who's coming over and it's just a super relaxed kind of just bring your best self or bring your real self
O,love it .
O,What a beautiful ritual .
O,Where should I go from here .
O,Well you mentioned the prepping for the interview and the anxiety .
O,Were there any questions that you hoped I would ask you like you know what . I have a really good answer to that .
O,I have a really good answer to this type of question .
O,I hope you ask me this or conversely reserve they were like I hope to God he really doesn't ask me this is a bit of a trick or is it .
O,Well I have to say you know I did do some research while I was a you know getting ready for the interview and I was really you know I listen to a lot of very impressive people on your podcast and I was really thinking to myself like I haven't written a book .
O,I don't have a method for anything .
O,So I was really hoping that you wouldn't ask me for some sort of dissertation on something .
O,You know I was thinking a lot
O,a couple of things that I was thinking about were just you know I was thinking about Soul Cycle a little bit and I was thinking kind of about what made the experience special and I was thinking about if we would talk about that a little bit just sort of about you know the construction of what that experience is like in the room and I think that's kind of an interesting one .
O,I you know I think that we've really crafted the experience in that room to be a lot of the things that I think people really need today .
O,And what we've done is we've really taken you know we've created an eight week training program for our instructors and what we teach in those three things is we teach them you know we teach them how to be spiritual and emotional leaders .
O,We teach them how to be physical fitness instructors so they can give people what they need for their bodies .
O,And we also teach them how to be deejays and how to create music like artists .
O,And what I think is really interesting about taking those three different tracks of you know psychology you know a physical experience and also creativity and putting them together is you really provide something for people in a room that allows them to access many different parts of themselves that I think people don't often get to access .
O,And I do think that there is something about that and about creating sort of that moment .
O,You know we we've created the class sort of in five stages .
O,I mean there's almost five stages that we break it down into which is you know we warm people up you know we pop the party we break them down we give them a soulful moment and we send them home like heroes you know .
O,And there is something about that emotional arc and that physical arc with music matching and all that I think really provides people with a lot of what they need to get today in the world .
O,And I think it's also a really interesting journey for people to go through together because although people aren't speaking and aren't communicating they are all experiencing a journey together .
O,And so there is it's a really interesting way in a world where people have almost forgotten how to communicate with each other because of phones and digital isolation to allow people to participate in something where they really do feel closer and connected to each other at the end .
O,I'd love to ask a bit more about the spiritual emotional leaders part .
O,What is the what does the curriculum look like for that
O,you know there are quite a few .
O,There's there's there's several parts of it and I think the main part of it is . Allowing people to . Have a place to be vulnerable to come and express their own vulnerabilities as well as to talk about things that are that they're thinking about their own vulnerabilities and then to empower people to really deliver messages to people that allow them to you know as they are wearing down physically as the music is playing as they are this close to somebody else who's moving with them .
O,We're teaching them to deliver messages that allow people to believe that there are enough that they can be more than they thought that they can be that they could achieve more than they thought that they could achieve
O,that . You know people are rooting for them that are hoping for them .
O,And I think that there is something about the empowerment that people get in that room when they are you know inhabiting their physical bodies in a way that feels strong and teaching those you know instructors to deliver messages of positivity you know to really they read they read a lot of you know different . Sure so many of the books that are on your list or books that we are giving them and those classes and what are some of them think about what people are reading .
O,You know the curriculum is actually wide and that's the other thing also because we've created it to look more like a framework .
O,And we all we also like to use the expression sort of freedom within framework .
O,So we are allowing people to you know to although they are creating within that framework to really you know find their own voice to find their own music .
O,And that's also why I think that our writers gravitate to different instructors because somebody that's moving me might not be the same person that moves you .
O,And yet we've kind of created this shell of an experience it's almost like a mad lib right .
O,Where did they learn sort of this this outline this technique and then they can take it and fill in their own content .
O,And aside from the Simon Sinek book that you mentioned which I do recommend people check out it does pop up a lot on the podcast .
O,Are there any other books that either you've recommended to managers or employees or that you've just recommended or gifted to other people .
O,Well I definitely give people a lot of people that Helen and Harvard Book that I was talking about getting the love you want
O,something else that we did a lot of reading at Soul Cycle is setting the table by Danny Meyer just for you know we we also ran incredibly interesting hospitality school for our for our people that worked in the front of house and not in those rooms .
O,You know we we're all big fans of the tony Shea book delivering happiness .
O,And I think those were like some of our favorites .
O,Danny Meyer's amazing .
O,Very very fascinating guy for people who don't recognize the name you should look it up .
O,How we do it our time .
O,I do not have a countdown .
O,Oh yes I do .
O,That .
O,Was it .
O,Thirty five .
O,Okay great .
O,Let's see .
O,I would love to hear what you are currently most excited about and why .
O,Because much like my question of the very beginning about what you saw in that bartender and how you kind of pick where you're going to allocate your time .
O,Mm hmm .
O,Right .
O,You've made some very deliberate choices and when you make a choice when you make a decision right you are cutting yourself off just like indecision .
O,You're cutting yourself off from other possibilities like that opportunity cost .
O,So what are you most excited about now . Professionally personally or anything in between .
O,It's funny to talk about opportunity cost because for the longest time I really thought you could just do everything .
O,And I'm starting to .
O,I'm starting to understand that there are only a certain amount of hours in the day .
O,But I will say that you know while sitting here in the middle of made by we it's really interesting because I think that it's definitely a good example of something that I am thinking a lot about these days which is you know how how are people connecting in a world where people spend most of their time on their phones or connecting digitally .
O,I think that's something that's really interesting to think about is you know where are the places and what are the experiences that we're delivering to people to allow them to connect .
O,You know we're reading about loneliness is an epidemic .
O,And I'm personally terrified watching my 13 year old and the way she interacts with her friends and their phones .
O,You know they're all in the same room and yet they're all on their phones communicating .
O,And so I am really obsessed with the fact that people are lonely and people are unhappy and how are we giving people skills to be happier and how are we giving them places to find those connections .
O,And so you know a place like this when I think about it it's really a new version of a community
O,center you know a place where we can go and especially in an economy where so many of us are now have the luxury of you know . Having our own company working by herself in our apartment .
O,Now that all sounds great until the day that you wake up and think I could really use somebody else around me to help me get inspired .
O,And so really thinking about you know how people connect and and what kind of tools we need to give them so that they can connect and connect in meaningful ways .
O,This is a beautiful space .
O,I mean I don't know how people in the audience feel but it's my first time here and I would love I could have used a place like this many years ago and hopefully there'll be many many more
O,come anytime .
O,Yeah absolutely absolutely stunning .
O,And let's let's wrap up with just a few final questions .
O,And this one sometimes a good question sometimes a terrible question .
O,We'll find out .
O,And that is if you could put a message question a quote anything at all .
O,And metaphorically speaking on a billboard to get a message out to millions or billions of people non-commercial for the time being .
O,Do you have any thoughts on what you might put on them .
O,For me this is very easy when you know I'm a terrible claustrophobic .
O,I did not know that .
O,Yes I am a terrible claustrophobic and ready for this .
O,I live in New York City .
O,I do not take elevators .
O,Like do not never don't take elevators I have gone to weddings black tie weddings at the Rainbow Room 71 flights .
O,I walk .
O,Yeah .
O,Wow .
O,So it's presumably you're not in like a you know running shoes when you go to such a function .
O,I have a whole situation .
O,I have my heels in a bag and I wear my sneakers up in full hair makeup outfit .
O,I make it to the top .
O,I blot I put my heels on and I walk out like nothing happens .
O,But yes I do .
O,Elevators are not my thing .
O,And so if I was going to put a billboard up I think that it would say there is no elevator to success . You have to take the stairs .
O,I love it .
O,I dig it .
O,And do you have any final comments asks recommendations anything at all that you like to say before we wrap up .
O,I don't think so .

O,And as soon as we had a chance the very first time to spend you know 10 or 15 minutes ago I was like I need to get her on the podcast at some point my head .
O,So here we are .
O,And it's been really fun .
O,I've taken so many notes and credits watch for taking all these notes for things that I'm going to follow up on and dig into
O,where are the best places for people to find you learn more about what you're up to . We work .
