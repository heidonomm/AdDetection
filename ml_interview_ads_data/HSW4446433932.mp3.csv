E-AD,Welcome to Step you should know a production of I Heart Radios How Stuff Works .
O,"Hey , welcome to the podcast ."
O,I'm Josh Clark .
O,There's Charles to Chuck .
O,There's guest producer role over there .
O,And that makes this stuff you should know about dogs .
O,We love dogs .
O,Heart them .
O,We talk a lot about dogs have dogs .
O,We have dogs .
O,Just love dogs in general .
O,They're the best .
O,"Train them up the end the train him right , though ."
O,Yeah .
O,This was an interesting one for me because I'm terrible at dog training .
O,And I just I do a mix of so many things .
O,I'm just mud .
O,Poor dogs don't even know to do none of their behaviors .
O,Their fault .
O,"Well , yeah , I think all my fault ."
O,That seems to be true among them .
O,"Like like I want to say not high end , but a good dog trainers , a professional dog trainer , high end trainers ."
O,Yeah .
O,"They they would agree that not just with you , but any dogs bad behavior as a result of their human not training them well or properly or at all ."
O,True .
O,Although I will say I mean any dog can be trained supposedly .
O,I've seen those shows .
O,"But you know , my dog Nico is just so ."
O,HotWired when someone jumps over now she's the the Brendel .
O,"OK , just so hotwired when people come over that I just don't know what to do ."
O,"What do you mean , HotWired ?"
O,Just so excited and like so excited she's about to implode into a nuclear fission reaction .
O,Okay .
O,"Like , just really , really low knows he knows , Nico ."
O,"It's like it's very , very tough to rein her in when someone knocks on that door and comes over ."
O,Okay .
O,She'll chill out after 10 minutes better .
O,"It's just hard to not get her to jump up on people and stuff because they got to be in on it , too , you know ?"
O,"Well , I would say that probably any high end dog trainer would wouldn't say that you should give her tranquilizers all the time , especially when somebody is coming over ."
O,"Well , you let her sleep her life away ."
O,"Your instinct as a dog owner is when someone comes over , your dog jumps on him and say , now , Nico , get down , get off of them and even like pull them off ."
O,"But this article says like , no , it even a scolding is reinforcing that behavior because all that dog wants is attention ."
O,Even if it's a scolding .
O,Right .
O,"And if you if you say no or whatever , the dog gets the attention , it prefer positive attention where you like ."
O,Yeah .
O,Jump up .
O,That's great .
O,"But it'll take , you know , Nico or any other dog will take ."
O,We'll take that .
O,They know what they say to do is to just ignore it .
O,Yeah .
O,Just ignore the dog until they're doing what you want them to do and then reward the dog .
O,And I think that what you just said and I'm glad you said it because we really need to get this across .
O,What people have been discovering more and more about dog training in the last like 20 years is that having a dog and raising a good dog is requires way more than we previously thought it did .
O,"Yeah , way more attention ."
O,Way more research .
O,Way more patients .
O,Way more persistence .
O,Way more than it used to .
O,And rightfully so .
O,"I mean , it should require this ."
O,And one of the reasons why it does require more is because there's been a real shift in mentality over what direction you should take to train a dog .
O,I keep saying raise the dog .
O,"I think that's a good way to put it , too ."
O,"Yeah , sure ."
O,"But it used to be different and it still is that way for some people , as we'll see ."
O,"But there there used to be much easier because you just asserted yourself physically , psychologically ."
O,"You yelled at your dog , you spanked your dog and you basically showed your dog who is boss ."
O,"And then after that , they would just kind of behave ."
O,"They're saying like , no , don't do that anymore ."
O,That's not good .
O,It really has really terrible effects on the dog .
O,It harms your relationship with the dog .
O,"And instead , you really need to just give 110 percent , whereas before you're giving maybe 50 percent ."
O,That's right .
O,"So what you're talking about are the two main approaches , dominance or positive reinforcement ?"
O,Positive reinforcement is a straight up operant conditioning technique where you reward your dog for good behaviors or I guess we should even say good and bad .
O,They say not to do that with children and dogs .
O,"Yeah , desirable behaviors and a focus on what a dog should do ."
O,Whereas dominance is a technique to discourage unwanted behaviors .
O,What you should not do and the whole dominance theory is based on this idea and this has been around since .
O,"Well , who knows where it got its original start , but at least since the 70s ."
O,"Yeah , there are these dog training monks in Cambridge , New York called the new skeet monks ."
O,And they are monks who raise and breed German shepherds .
O,Sure .
O,And write doctrine books .
O,All right .
O,"Well , I mean , that's monks are supposed to give something back to the world , some to get through beer ."
O,And these guys train dogs .
O,I like the beer brewers .
O,Better cider .
O,Yeah .
O,It's been at least around since then .
O,But this is based on the the idea that dogs are really just wolves 2.0 in dog's clothing here and that wolves we should look at the behavior of wolves and their pack animals with an alpha male and an alpha female will get more into that and we can extrapolate that to dogs .
O,"And so that's how and this is what these monks say , too ."
O,That's what you should be doing is mimicking what wolves do .
O,And .
O,Well .
O,But say the wild .
O,Not that .
O,"Not the case , really ."
O,"What wolves have been studied doing in captivity , which is a key point ."
O,Right .
O,"And then like because they have pacts with a leader , call an alpha male , an alpha female , the alpha male and female maintain their position through dominance , through acts of like aggression ."
O,Yeah .
O,Violence .
O,And that they're constantly challenged for these positions .
O,So that so much so that this constant struggle over dominance and Alpha Adam is what shapes Wolf .
O,"Society , and that if you take that and you just assume , like you said , that dogs are just a different type of Wolf , that they're so closely related to wolves and descended from wolves that the same kind of mentality applies to dogs ."
O,If you create that .
O,Kind of situation in your own home .
O,"You will have a happier or more obedient dog who understands its place in this household , which to your dog is just a pack ."
O,That's right .
O,This is started in the 1960s .
O,There were a bunch of studies observing these wolf packs and their social structures .
O,I saw it even earlier than that .
O,"I saw a guy named Rudolf Schenkel was doing this in 1947 and that he's the one who coined the site , the idea and the term Alpha ."
O,"And he was also the guitarist for the Scorpions , if I'm not mistaken ."
O,"I think you think in a John Fogarty's guitarist , which is that it was his brother , Rudy Schenkel , pretty cool ."
O,"So , yeah ."
O,"So they're there observing these wolves and they're saying that there's a continual pattern in them in the pack of the male members vying for control , challenging the alpha , then the alpha , putting it down , usually physically and also psychologically ."
O,I guess as much as you can get into the psychology of a wolf .
O,And here's the thing .
O,"I mean , should we go ahead and say what the deal is ?"
O,I feel like that's or should that be a third X spoiler ?
O,"No , no ."
O,I think we can go ahead .
O,All right .
O,I said they were studying captive wolves .
O,"That's that's the rub here , is that they're studying wolves in captivity ."
O,And it took this other guy in the .
O,When was that than the 90s .
O,Yeah .
O,David Mack .
O,"Yeah , that actually studied Wolves in the Wild ."
O,"And he's like , that's not what's going on at all because you're it's like studying humans in a refugee camp or a prison ."
O,Like the behaviors aren't gonna be the same .
O,"What I'm observing is these animals that follow what most animals in the animal kingdom do or many , which is their their families ."
O,And the alpha is the alpha course .
O,He's the dad .
O,Right .
O,Exactly .
O,"Then like when they said like , oh , no , wolves are constantly , you know , under these physical attacks for their status as the Alpha Alpha , Wolf ."
O,They what they were saying was like these these wolves are in a completely unnatural setting in situation .
O,And you've got a bunch of different alphas who are trying to figure out who's in charge .
O,"And yeah , there was a lot of aggression and dominance , but this was a terrible thing to base this idea on how to train a dog because it was a totally artificial situation ."
O,And it wasn't until I think .
O,"What did you say , 1990 , that Meck ."
O,He actually revised an earlier book .
O,"He wrote a book in 1980 that took these earlier ideas and said , yeah , these are totally correct ."
O,"And now he's like , I wish I'd never I got it so wrong ."
O,"Yes , there is dominance ."
O,There are alphas .
O,"But it's like you said , Chuck , their mom and dad ."
O,That's what we would call them .
O,Just right .
O,Just in the same way that your mom and your dad are the boss of you and you're a kid .
O,Same thing in a wolf pack .
O,Yeah .
O,"And dad goes out and gets the food moms , takes care of the kids and protects the kids and access , you know , the defensive guard over their den ."
O,Yes .
O,And that's just how it works .
O,"And then after a couple of years , the male puppies , I guess , leave ."
O,They become alphas of their own families .
O,"And he observed the stuff over , whereas at Canada's Ellesmere Island every summer for 13 years , and that island has the best carnival in Canada ."
O,It really changed the way people looked at wolves and aragao dogs .
O,Yeah .
O,For the what the revision of it or the earlier stuff ?
O,"Well , the revision of it ."
O,Sure .
O,Yeah .
O,It totally did because everybody realized that this dominance based training that people had been doing where you basically beat up your dog .
O,"If there if there is like a sense of like alpha dumb that your dog is following , your dog is basically like my dad is beating me up and yelling at me all the time ."
O,And I'm just scared and anxious about everything .
O,"So the did the dog training world realize that this is what was happening , that it was based on faulty preliminary original research and they they switched ."
O,They changed .
O,"They went to a much more respectful , happier , friendlier way of training that doesn't involve punishment ."
O,It involves basically rewards and extinctions as well .
O,We'll look at later on .
O,All right .
O,"Well , let's take a break ."
O,We're talking about beating up your dog .
O,"But when we come back , we'll talk about specific techniques that people that subscribe to the dominance theory believe in ."

O,All right .
O,So you talked about people heating up their dogs .
O,"I know you're sort of kidding , but there are actual physical things that they say to do in dominants training and they are as follows ."
O,"One is called the alpha role , not r o l e ."
O,"That's right , the other R O L L got it ."
O,So this is when the trainer will ah .
O,"You know , I guess if you're the owner and trainer will pin the dog on its back and hold the dog there by the chest or the throat ."
O,Mm hmm .
O,Until the dog gives in and then stops the struggle .
O,"OK , that is slightly different than dominants down ."
O,That is pinning the dog on its side until the dog stops struggling .
O,So same thing .
O,"I mean , you got a dog that is doing something that you don't want it to do ."
O,So you are pinning it .
O,You're physically restraining in an aggressive manner until it just basically dies inside .
O,I will say that I have I have done the dominants down before because of a dog fight between my two dogs .
O,OK .
O,"Getting the dog separated and then , you know , pinning one down until they calm down ."
O,"One thing I saw somewhere , I don't know where I saw it , but the actually I've heard it I heard a little while ago , the way that you break up a dog fight is you grab them by the backlight is to rub yourself a stake ."
O,Just walk through me like this .
O,Why fight when you can have state ?
O,Grab the back legs ?
O,"Yeah , that makes sense ."
O,"Here's the thing , though ."
O,"If you've ever been involved in a dog fight up close , it's an adrenaline rush ."
O,You don't know quite what to do now .
O,And it's scary .
O,It's like super scary .
O,"Yeah , well , your brain just becomes totally like my brain becomes clouded when like Momo's starts barking at somebody ."
O,"I'm like , I get all flustered ."
O,"And whatever a dog fight is like , it is one of the most fluttering , like clouding experiences you can you can have ."
O,I've heard throw water on him .
O,I could see that .
O,I could also see him just fighting right through the water if the fight is bad enough .
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , my dog Lucy , who isn't with us , got into a fight with my former co dog , Jake , the pit bull who , you know , my friend Justin ended up taking ."
O,And it was ugly men .
O,And they're both not with us and they're both really sweet dogs .
O,But they looked at each other wrong .
O,"And it was on from the get go , man ."
O,"And like , Lucy took off part of Jake's ear and it was just like ."
O,It's bad how scary you don't know what to do .
O,Right .
O,"And so a person who who is who subscribes to dominance theory training says you need to show that both of those dogs that you're in charge and you tell them they're not fighting , they're that they're acting out , they're misbehaving because they don't understand their role ."
O,"But at the same time , I would be like , well , no , it sounds like that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't think you're the alpha ."
O,"They're trying to figure out what their position over one another in this package or just dogs being dogs , man ."
O,"That's another way to look at it , for sure ."
O,"You know , like , you know , Lucy got attacked at a dog park when she was young ."
O,"And from that day forward was , you know , if a dog was slightly aggressive , it was on and scary ."
O,Yeah .
O,So we can take her around other dogs .
O,So the upshot .
O,Yeah .
O,And they would say so .
O,One of the other things I want to call out here rather than waiting .
O,"When a dog acts aggressively , every trainer I've seen on both sides says that it's fearful that the dog is actually afraid ."
O,Oh that was for sure .
O,Lucy's case .
O,Yeah .
O,So yeah .
O,"And that's why I thought of that , because , you know , she had a negative experience and she was afraid ."
O,So she would act aggressive in the face of fear .
O,"So one of the reasons why people criticize dominance training , as we'll see , is that you are physically and aggressively punishing aggressive behavior ."
O,Right .
O,"So your fear , punishing a dog for feeling fearful , which is going to make it more fearful of whatever it is it's afraid of at that moment , which means it's actually probably likelier that it will become more aggressive ."
O,Right .
O,Yeah .
O,"It's like a human kid , too ."
O,"You know , if you have a kid who has learned to be aggressive and your way of disciplining them is to hit them like what he think's going to happen ."
O,I don't know .
O,I don't know anything about human kids .
O,I only know about dogs .
O,They're the same .
O,"So back to the the physical methods of dominance , training , those alpha role dominance down ."
O,There's these scruff shake .
O,Mm hmm .
O,"So when he grabbed the dog's jowls , their scruff with both hands and shake it really hard and stare them stare them in the eyes ."
O,"Lease jerk , if you're on a on a walk with your dog and they're pulling you , let them get up ahead and then jerk back really , really hard ."
O,Sure .
O,"And then using choke collars or pinch collars or shock collars instead of like the more humane , gentle leaders , what they call them ."
O,Right .
O,"It sort of looks like a muzzle , but when the dog pulls , it just sort of pulls their nose down ."
O,They don't like that .
O,Right .
O,"That's for the other kind of dominance , the gentle leader ."
O,Physically hurting them when they pull on the leash .
O,Correct .
O,Or when you jerk the leash back .
O,Right .
O,Or the choke pinch or shock collars are all dominance .
O,Right .
O,Or there's psychological methods to staring at the dog till the dog looks away .
O,Like I'm boss .
O,Who's gonna blink first ?
O,You dog ?
O,You all right ?
O,Or growling at a dog or making dog noises to the dog is another dominance technique .
O,Yeah .
O,Psychological dominance .
O,Right .
O,So .
O,So you've got all these techniques .
O,"As far as dominance training goes , if you employ them in a consistent manner ."
O,Eventually your dog is going to figure out who's boss .
O,And they the people who subscribe to dominance theory say this is actually a gift to your dog .
O,Right .
O,"Because if your dog is acting improperly , if it's misbehaving , if it's being aggressive , it's asserting itself because it doesn't realize that you're the alpha , because you haven't asserted yourself over your dog ."
O,And so somebody's got to be the alpha .
O,So this dog is confused and is trying to step up .
O,"So if you assert your dominance over this dog , you will reassure that if there is an alpha in charge and it can just relax and be a good , happy dog ."
O,That's what people who who subscribe to dominance theory say is the whole purpose of dominance theory .
O,Right .
O,"On the other side , you have people saying , no , your dog is not just becoming super happy because they know you're in charge ."
O,"They're going on into shut down mode , basically because they're afraid to do stuff and they're basically living in a state of shut down mode because they're afraid of being alpha rolled or barked at or pinned or whatever ."
O,Yeah .
O,"And so that what they'll do is here's the thing , and this is really important to remember ."
O,"Nobody's saying dominance training doesn't actually , at least in the short term , curb problem behavior and dies ."
O,But the way that you're doing is actually like breaking the dog's spirit .
O,You're not you're not providing it this comfortable position in the household .
O,It's pack .
O,You're basically just breaking the spirit so that it doesn't do anything until you tell it to do something .
O,It's that shut down that you were just talking about .
O,"And people who subscribe to the other way say , no , there's a there's a different , better way to do this , which doesn't involve breaking the dog , which allows the dog to lead a happier , healthier life ."
O,"And there's what's called the least intrusive , minimally aversive list of how to train a dog ."
O,And using dominance theory techniques are well at the bottom of this list .
O,"Yeah , I think they listed six things ."
O,And that was number six was a positive punishment .
O,Mm hmm .
O,"Which is a bit of a contradiction in terms , I guess , but ."
O,"Yeah , yeah ."
O,Let's talk about that .
O,"Yeah , that's what the whole list are ."
O,Just the positive punishment .
O,Well just about the .
O,Yeah .
O,The punishment problem .
O,Yeah .
O,I mean that's when you're delivering what they called an aversive consequence or I guess the first consequence to reduce probability that a behavior will occur .
O,Yeah .
O,So in this in the sense positive and negative doesn't necessarily mean like good or bad .
O,Right .
O,It can easing the introduction or the removal of something .
O,Right .
O,"So you can have a negative reward where something bad is removed in reward for the , you know , the dog doing the behavior you want ."
O,And then you also have negative punishment where you remove something good when the dog does something you don't want it to do .
O,"You also have positive rewards , which is basically giving a treat to a dog ."
O,It does something good .
O,"You say , Hey , Hugo or praise or something like that ."
O,Sure .
O,"And then positive punishment , which sounds like okay that's an alright kind of punishment ."
O,That's actually the worst of all of them as far as most professional dog trainers are concerned .
O,That is where you're introducing a punishment because the dog is doing something .
O,"So you're yelling at the dog , you're alpha rolling the dog , you're spanking the dog ."
O,You're introducing a punishment as a response for an unwanted behavior in this hope to train the dog .
O,"And so they say , well , here's there's the basic problem right there with dominance theory and dominance training is that eventually you're going to come to positive punishment ."
O,It's woven into the fabric of dominance theory .
O,And if you're .
O,Punishing your dog if you're yelling at your dog or alphaville your dog .
O,You're going to create this shut down dog .
O,"And what's more , it seems that positive punishment as far as training techniques , conditioning , operant conditioning techniques go , is the least effective of all of those four ."
O,"And not it's not just dog trainers saying that even B.F. Skinner himself , who created a Skinner box and raises poor little barefoot , electrocuted children ."
O,"And he said , yes , positive punishment is the least effective of all of these ."
O,"Yeah , they say the number one on that list is health , nutritional and physical factors ."
O,And this is basically setting up your house .
O,"Then being assured that your dog is like healthy and well-fed , mean , like there's nothing physically wrong with the dog ."
O,"Yeah , like if your dog is peeing in the house and won't get housebroken , they're saying the first step you should do is take your dog to a vet and make sure it doesn't have like a urinary tract infection ."
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , let's go over this list because that's really helpful ."
O,There was the Association of Professional Dog Trainers have a list of misinterpretations urinating the houses .
O,"One of them , a dominance explanation would be like , no , they're peeing on your bed because they're trying to show , say , like , this is my territory ."
O,"It's a really paranoid place to come from , you know ?"
O,"Oh , the dog ."
O,The dog thinks he's better than me .
O,"What was really going on , they say , is that it's just that horsetrading has been inconsistent ."
O,Yes .
O,Which .
O,Sorry .
O,You have a urinary tract infection or something .
O,Right .
O,"And you would find that out by taking that first step , which is taking the dog to the vet to make sure there isn't a health or medical issue that can solve this problem ."
O,"Because , again , it all comes down to this problem behavior ."
O,Why is the dog doing it or what do you want the dog to do instead ?
O,Right .
O,Jumping up on people .
O,This is Nico Steele .
O,A dominants explanation would be that she's doing this to assert their height and rank over you like I'm just as big as you are .
O,Whereas what's really going on is she wants to lick your face and it's fun and she's excited and wants to say hello .
O,Right .
O,So what you would do is you would say teach your dog to sit whenever you go to open the door or something like that .
O,"Or if your dog is jumping up to to ignore it until it's sitting with all all four paws on the floor and then you reward it cause it's like you were saying , one of the easiest ways to train your dog is accidentally ."
O,And what you're doing is training your dog to do all the stuff you don't want your dog to do .
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , you come home from vacation and Nico jumps up on you like your first instinct is to kiss her face and tell her how good it is to see her ."
O,And that's the wrong thing to do .
O,"Like , I'm good at that ."
O,"Like , I can come in and just turn my back and ignore and it works ."
O,"But you got to get people coming in the house , all your friends coming in and family ."
O,Yeah .
O,Everyone's got to be on board .
O,Yeah .
O,Like like momma barks at strangers when they come into our house .
O,"She does not like to like , say , a contractor coming over to to bark or to come to her house ."
O,She should like it .
O,"So ideally I would give the stranger treats , say the contractor Trilby likes liked by the way ."
O,Can you show up 5 minutes early to an appointment ?
O,I'm going to give you a dog lie to treat under the door .
O,You and I are going to go and sit and get situated at the at the table .
O,At the dinner table .
O,Yeah .
O,"We're gonna just talk calmly and then my wife is going to bring my dog into the room and you're going to give her a treat , right ?"
O,Don't stand up in the presence of my dog .
O,"Once my wife removes our dog , then we can go on with our appointment ."
O,I love it .
O,That would be the ideal thing .
O,What this what this thing says to do is okay instead of all that .
O,Just keep your dog outside .
O,Go hang out outside with your dog .
O,Yeah .
O,Make us see your dog has no idea anybody even came over .
O,"Yeah , that's easier sometimes ."
O,Yes .
O,That's the number two thing that you're supposed to do after taking the dog to a vet is just changing the dog's world .
O,Yeah .
O,So that the problem behavior doesn't exist because the thing that creates that problem behavior isn't part of the dog's world anymore .
O,Yeah .
O,SITUATION last week where I was out of town .
O,"You know , we had our house worked on and the contractor , the framer guy who was there most of the time , like Hands-On , really loves dogs and loves our dogs ."
O,But he had to come over and do something .
O,"He hadn't been over in a while and I was gone and I was like , you know , I can tell you how to get in my house if you want to go put them in the in the bedroom so the plumber can come in ."
O,"Was like , this is on you , man ."
O,"If you want to do this , he's like , sure , I'll do it ."
O,"And he came in and text me afterward that said that , Charlie ."
O,"He said as soon as I walked in , bolted and ran into the bedroom basically ."
O,Oh .
O,And that Nico like barked embarked and then was just like downstairs trembling and afraid .
O,"And he eventually was like , come on Nico , come on up ."
O,And he got her into the bedroom .
O,That is so bad .
O,That is so sad .
O,"It's but it's also really sad , too , when you think about your dog ."
O,"You know , barking or being aggressive or something ."
O,"Oh , yeah ."
O,"When you're just like , oh , it's so obnoxious ."
O,Be quiet .
O,"But then if you realize like they're actually doing it cause they're scared , which now makes the whole thing just heartbreaking ."
O,"But I think it's a really important thing to remember , too , because it changes your perspective on how it goes from being like stop being aggressive , stopping hostile , you know , to to realizing you're saying stop being afraid , you know , stuffing a chicken ."
O,That's no way to talk to something that you love .
O,"And that holds true for a dog , too ."
O,So to think that really kind of changes your perspective .
O,"Yeah , the ."
O,"Of my monologue and then a couple of other behaviors pulling on a leash , a dominants explanation might be that , no , they're trying to assert that they're the Alphen get out in front of you and be in charge , whereas what's really get known on is your dogs excited to be on a walk and they love to get out there and smell things ."
O,Mm hmm .
O,And that's why they're pulling .
O,And then finally running through the doorway .
O,"First , I get run over by my dogs all the time trying to get outside ."
O,Sure .
O,And the dominance theory is that they're trying to push you out of the way to show you they're in charge .
O,"Again , they what they're doing is pushing out of the way because you're blocking them from getting outside to where they love life a lot more ."
O,Right .
O,"So in this really kind of , I think , does a beautiful job chunk of putting side-by-side the dominance theory and the what is it , the positive positive reinforcement to get the positive reinforcement for your theory ."
O,Those are the two main ones .
O,"But just the day , almost night and day ways that they see dogs ."
O,Yeah .
O,Like what makes dogs ?
O,Dogs that to a dominance theory person .
O,The dogs just like I'm in charge of you get out of my way where the the positive reinforcement theory says Dog just likes to go have fun in it .
O,"And it's really not very concerned with , you know , social niceties of letting you go first ."
O,It wants to go have fun immediately .
O,It doesn't really have anything to do with you .
O,It's a dog .
O,Exactly .
O,"I just I don't know if everyone's figured this out or not , but I tend to fall a little more on the positive reinforcement side ."
O,Same here .
O,"So let's take a break then and talk about a little bit more about the problems with dominance training , but then the joy and the goodness that is positive reinforcement ."
O,Beautiful .

O,All right .
O,"So earlier in the show , you said that dominance training can achieve results ."
O,No one argues that that can be effective at times .
O,But we talked about why it's effective that your dog is being shut down .
O,"Essentially , your dog might be fearful ."
O,And one of the other problems besides harming the relationship between you and your dog that you might even know is armed .
O,Right .
O,"Is that if your dog is aggressive at all , this can really ramp that up and that can be a big problem ."
O,Yeah .
O,"Because again , you're punishing your dog for being fearful if it's if you're punishing it for aggressiveness and you're just making it more fearful ."
O,"So to the other big problems that can arise from dominance training or injury to the dog , if you say , you know , do an alpha role too hard and you break its rib or something like that , that can happen ."
O,"Or if you're instilling further aggressiveness in the dog , an injury to you or the trainer or somebody else ."
O,"Yeah , there was a study in 2009 , so it's a little old , but I imagine it's still pretty true ."
O,Published in the Applied Behavioral Science .
O,I guess journal. .
O,"Extravaganza , they survey dog owners who had reported problem behavior and aggression ."
O,"They completed this survey about their training techniques and of the dogs that were physically punished , hit or kick , which I can't even go there ."
O,My mind now giving up your dog .
O,43 percent of those dogs responded with aggression .
O,OK .
O,The .
O,"And then what else did you grow , get a dog , it was 41 percent of dogs became aggressive ."
O,Around .
O,Yep .
O,Okay .
O,The staring is 30 percent .
O,"The scruff shake , 26 percent of dogs were aggressive ."
O,A response in an alpha role was 31 percent .
O,Right .
O,"And this is one reason , another reason why there's a near-consensus , despite what Cesar Millan might say on dominants training not being the way to go ."
O,The Association of Professional Dog Trainers .
O,International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants .
O,"American Visionary , Society of Animal Behavior , Pet Professional Guide and the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers ."
O,All say this is not the way Cesar .
O,"Yeah , they say it's like not only is it bad for the dog , it's not rooted in science that the whole thing that dominance theory was based on is not correct ."
O,"Yeah , the whole wolf thing ."
O,Yeah .
O,"But Cesar will still say I mean he's still out there saying , nope , animals love ."
O,They want to be in a pack and they want to have a strong pack leader .
O,Right .
O,And that is up to you to be that pack leader .
O,Yeah .
O,So this article kind of says that basically the people who are into dominance are amature dog trainers .
O,Right .
O,UNaccredited .
O,And I guess not high end is the way .
O,"I wouldn't put it , you know , 20 minutes ago ."
O,And the a lot of pet dominance training tool industry people .
O,Sure .
O,"Like that sell the shock collars , right ?"
O,Exactly .
O,Yes .
O,And then people who watch Cesar meone right .
O,"Because he is he's a force unto himself as far as dominance training goes , because people watch his show and they're like , oh , wow , this really works ."
O,Liking goats to a dog .
O,"And the dog will like , stop doing what you want to do ."
O,Yeah .
O,And so he does he produces results .
O,"But again , that that question of what what kind of a dog or what kind of a mentality he's producing in the dog or that that kind of training produces in dog ."
O,That's that's what's that question .
O,It's also it's heavily edited TV show .
O,We have to remember .
O,It is .
O,"Well , you know , he got in a lot of I want to say , gotten a lot of trouble ."
O,Hot water .
O,Maybe a little bit by water .
O,There was like a petition that got like 10000 signatures to have a show canceled on Nathan National Geographic because he's the pig .
O,"Yeah , the pig thing where he ."
O,There was a French bulldog that had killed two potbelly pigs in its pass .
O,"And the owner was like , I don't want my dog to kill pigs anymore ."
O,"Caesar's like , I have just the idea ."
O,Let's put it in a pen with another pig .
O,And apparently it was going very well .
O,But then they let it off of the lead and the dog attacked the pig and took a chunk out of its ear .
O,And they aired this and I'm sure they aired it because they were trying to be true to their documentary roots .
O,"I guess rather than just editing the whole thing out , be like , well , we can't show that they included it ."
O,And there was a lot of outrage .
O,"And they were like , this is a clear act of animal abuse ."
O,Like this pig was harmed because of this shows actions and Caesar Juan's actions .
O,"And there was an investigation by Los Angeles County , I think , to see whether , you know , they could charge him with animal abuse ."
O,And they cleared him eventually .
O,"But it created it produced this round of of interviews for him , a lot of publicity for the show ."
O,But also he did a lot of interviews .
O,"And in every single one , he said , I understand that , you know , the people who are who are who prompted this investigation care about animals ."
O,"And they are , you know , the people who are doing the investigating are doing their job ."
O,And they should .
O,And it's it's great .
O,No cooperate .
O,"But in every single one , he stood by dominants training ."
O,He did not question it for a second .
O,That's true .
O,"You know , he still believes in it for sure ."
O,"So on the other side , we have positive reinforcement ."
O,And that's generally like a two pronged thing where you reward good behavior .
O,"And this next part is really key because it's easy to reward good behavior , but not accidentally reinforcing bad behavior , which you talked about earlier , which is someone comes in , Nico jumps on them , and my instinct is to pullar often say , no , I am reinforcing that bad behavior just by giving her even negative attention ."
O,Right .
O,Exactly .
O,So so what ?
O,So the whole point of positive reinforcement is ignoring the behavior that you don't want to happen .
O,Right .
O,Which means you're not accidentally reinforcing bad behavior and then rewarding the behavior that you do want to happen .
O,"So in the case of Nico , the ."
O,"The part where you're ignoring it's called extinction , where this idea that the unwanted behavior goes away if you do nothing when you come in and she's jumping up , you just turn your back to her and ignore and just go about your business and say , I'm packing your shoes ."
O,"Maybe you've got a wet bathing suit that you need to get out of your suitcase with my massagers , that kind of thing ."
O,"You know , you've just come home from a beach vacation , as did she does this when I go get the mail ."
O,OK .
O,"Hey , wow ."
O,"OK , let's see you come back and you're looking through your your mail , your Garnet Hill catalog ."
O,"And , you know , you're thinking maybe I will spend a little more on Halloween decorations than last year ."
O,And you you you're ignoring or you're just doing your thing .
O,"And then the moment she sits quietly and looks up at you , bam , you're there with the treat ."
O,"Yeah , but the tug of roe , tug of war , rope , the verbal prey ."
O,"Oh , yeah ."
O,You're like you right there .
O,And then you go back to it .
O,She jumps up and you go right back to your mail .
O,You just totally ignore in the moment her feet are on the floor .
O,"Bam , you're right back there with another treat ."
O,"So you're you're very consistently this is really , really key ."
O,You're consistently rewarding the behavior that you want and you're consistently ignoring the behavior that you don't want .
O,Yeah .
O,"And again , I'm pretty good about this with myself ."
O,"And she doesn't jump on me , but it's just it's with other folks ."
O,"So that's the thing I got to really , really work on ."
O,"Some of our closest friends come over a lot , understand and they ignore her and try and turn their back and stuff until she comes down ."
O,They hate me .
O,"Oh , goodness ."
O,Another thing you can use is the clicker .
O,That is something you hold in your hand that makes this clicking sound .
O,And you just sort of reinforce that along with the treat .
O,But they hear that click .
O,"And I guess it's sort of like that Pavlovian response where the precision of that click , it makes it easier for them to to put two and two together ."
O,"And pretty soon you can make that click and they know like you , you know , maybe I'll just sit down and behave because the treats coming my way while you're with the click , I think you're more marking the behavior like there's five different things that she's doing , as she say , settling in or whatever ."
O,"Maybe she was looking up out the window and you say , good girl , because she sitting down ."
O,"But to her , you're saying good girl because she's looking out the window ."
O,"If you clicked , if you click the moment she sat down and settled , she would know that what you were talking about was the seating , the sitting part rather than the looking out the window part ."
O,"The clickers just it's it happened so fast , it allows the dog to mark that behavior more than your praise ."
O,Right .
O,"Because it takes a lot longer to say , Neeko , you're so good ."
O,Exactly .
O,Then that little click .
O,So you'd want to click first and then hit her with the praise .
O,"But the click is like , oh , that thing ."
O,That's right .
O,And the consistency that you were talking about is so key because you can be going down a good path for a couple of weeks and undo it all in a couple of days or even a single action .
O,"If you're not consistent with , you know , this training ."
O,"But but it's like with the the peeing in the house thing , maybe in the house the house training that you engage in originally did you didn't quite finish ."
O,You weren't quite consistent enough .
O,So go start over .
O,"It's not like it's like , oh , well I'll never have a nice frog again for a dog just pees in the house ."
O,"It's like , no you you go back to house training your dog or ."
O,Right .
O,"You know , if you have this , whatever the unwanted behavior is , you just have to go back to it and do it again ."
O,And your dog will pick it up probably way faster the second time and you just stick to it .
O,"It's just more consistency , which is why I was saying earlier , it's , you know , a little more involved owning a dog than we used to think it was ."
O,"But the dogs that were , you know , like sharing our lives with our , I would argue , are way happier and healthier mentally and probably physically , too , than say they were 30 years ago in general ."
O,Yeah .
O,"And there is a certain amount , you know , you don't get dogs and cats if you want to have ."
O,"Well , not necessarily true , but if you need a pristine house that's hairless , you probably shouldn't have pets ."
O,Like there's a certain amount of giving in to the fact that .
O,"I mean , and you may have rules where they pets aren't allowed on any furniture , which is great ."
O,That helps .
O,"But like in my house , they're furniture dogs ."
O,"So we know our son room couch is never going to be the nicest , greatest couch in the world ."
O,Mm hmm .
O,It's always going to have some dog hair on it .
O,And that's just the way it is .
O,That's fine with us .
O,Yeah .
O,"You , me and I are defiant ."
O,We have not one but two white couches .
O,Yeah .
O,"Luckily , my mom doesn't shed , but far as my lover thrown up on the couch ."
O,"No , she hasn't ."
O,And I know now that I'm saying this back at home that she's throwing up on the couch for the first time ever .
O,"Ah , you know , my friend Justin , he and his partner Melissa have a great dog named Foley , who is Nico's best friend ."
O,And Foley is not allowed on their furniture and is really good about it .
O,But he is allowed on our furniture .
O,"Oh , yeah ."
O,So and Foley comes over for spend the nights and playtime's he fully milks that stuff .
O,"Yeah , but it doesn't they ."
O,And I was worried I was gonna mess them up at home but it hasn't .
O,He gets a difference .
O,Yeah .
O,I think probably because dogs are a lot smarter than we give them credit for .
O,Probably he probably likes has been or do .
O,I can tell you my mom was very smart .
O,Yeah .
O,My dogs are smart and dumb you know .
O,Yeah .
O,Okay .
O,That's a good way for a dog to be too .
O,It's like sometimes you think and what a smart dog .
O,"And then you see them eating like poop out of the cat litter box , like , well , you're really not very smart ."
O,"After the other , like I God ."
O,Or they come around the corner with cat litter on their nose .
O,"They're like , what ?"
O,I wouldn't do anything right .
O,Oh yeah .
O,Pull it off .
O,Just play it cool .
O,So they know anything .
O,They can't prove anything .
O,You got anything else about cat poop ?
O,I got nothing else .
O,Don't hit and kick your dogs .
O,Man .
O,"Yeah , don't beat up your dogs ."
O,"Well , if you want to know more about dog training , there is a lot to go read about on the Internet and a lot of his conflicting , so definitely choose wisely ."
O,"Since I said choose wisely , it's time for a listener mail ."
O,Call this one that delighted us .
O,I think you probably read this one .
O,I enjoyed the short stuff guys on barbed-wire .
O,I want to share the fact that my great great grandfather won a William Harvey Beale invented the barbed-wire Hytner .
O,Nice .
O,How about that ?
O,Yeah .
O,This is what enabled ranchers and farmers to install their own fencing .
O,"I am the 12th generation in a long line of Beale's that began in the U.S. in the 16 eighties from England , first landing in Pennsylvania and gradually migrating westward ."
O,I don't know why that might .
O,Have you ever .
O,You watch what we do in the shadows .
O,I have seen it here .
O,There .
O,Yes .
O,"So , you know , it was a it was a movie ."
O,And now it's a TV show .
O,It's Heath .
O,Each one of the elder vampires .
O,"Any time that he nuther on Staten Island and he talks about Manhattan , he calls it Manhattan ."
O,That's hilarious .
O,"But there's no reason for it to be hilarious , but it just cracks ."
O,I think that .
O,I like the TV show more than the movie because almost exclusively because of Matthew Berry .
O,Really ?
O,I think anything he's in is just because this guy is good .
O,It's great .
O,"You know , one of the writers on this show and producers , Tom Shaquem of this show ."
O,Wow .
O,"Anyway , I don't know how that reminded me of it ."
O,I think I was thinking about them landing in Pennsylvania and what it was called back then Pennsylvania .
O,Back to the letter .
O,"William Harvey , who's generation eight , was home studying Kansas in 1889 and took a job as a barbed wire fence salesman ."
O,And he said that goodness knows there was plenty of fencing being shipped into the country by that time .
O,You couldn't do any good trying to farm without it .
O,Big problem there for farmers .
O,They got the fence up was how to pull the wire tight on the post .
O,"So he tinkered in a forge and developed a device to pull the wire tight , took out a patent , and was soon selling the bill wire Teichner to quote every bedeviled fence tender for miles around in ."
O,She set pictures of the device and the patent and William working on a ranch .
O,And it was great .
O,She said he traveled around the west .
O,He traveled around the West for eight years .
O,"Selling his invention was able to pay off his debts , eventually moved to California for the next four generations remain ."
O,I'm writing from San Diego .
O,I know all these details .
O,Thanks to Williams youngest daughter who recorded extensive oral histories and books .
O,What a great letter .
