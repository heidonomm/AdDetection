O,Thank you for listening .
O,The human experience is in session my guest today is Mr. Mark Manson .
O,Mark my good sir welcome to H XP .
O,Thanks for having me .
O,Good to be here .
O,Markets it's pretty interesting that your career has shifted so much when you your shirt off as a blogger and now you've moved into this sort of entrepreneurship and you've written a couple books now right .
O,Oh yeah .
O,This is my second book but it's the first with a publisher .
O,The book has a not so subtle title .
O,It's called the subtle art of not giving a fuck a counterintuitive approach to living a good life .
O,Was was the self-help industry something that was I mean I think you said this I think that the self-help industry is pretty saturated when you say
O,Yeah it's very crowded .
O,Did you feel like you had to put this book out because because of that reason .
O,So I have a certain style of writing which is I tend to be very irreverent vulgar incorporate a lot of humor into my work and I think on the one hand that has helped me differentiate myself but I also think it's it's integral in some ways to the topics that I write about .
O,Yeah absolutely .
O,The the back flap of your your cover says in life we have a limited amount of fucks to give .
O,So you must choose your fox wisely which is hilarious .
O,I mean but I mean let's dig into that .
O,I mean how how do we choose our fox wisely as you say .
O,Well essentially it's what we're talking about is values and what the really what the book is about is our values .
O,What are we choosing to find important .
O,What are we choosing as the drivers and motivators in our lives .
O,And I think a lot of people don't consciously cite those or that are very few people actually sit down and think about those where they came from why they adopted them .
O,This book is very much designed to help people ask those questions .
O,Do you think I mean do you think that there's a lot of snake oil going on in the industry where people are kind of running seminars and they're moving into coaching and kind of doing these different things to kind of lure people in .
O,Yeah I think I think snake oil is kind of a pretty strong word .
O,I'm sure there's some of that .
O,I think there's a lot of good intentions that are misguided misguided good intentions in this industry .
O,A lot of people who honestly believe that they are helping others and that they want to help others but there is a little bit of a blind leading the blind .
O,Yeah .
O,Going back to your values .
O,I mean what are these what are those some of those core values that we can kind of identify with .
O,So the book makes an argument or things that are pretty simple and ordinary .
O,You know it's a lot of a lot of our culture not just self-help but a lot of our culture in general is built on this idea of doing incredible things having incredible experiences pursuing more more and more all the time .
O,And I wanted to make the argument that you know maybe a happy and stable life doesn't come down to always achieving or having more maybe it comes down to simplifying and being satisfied with less .
O,And that's a very uncomfortable idea for many people to consider .
O,Hence why all the humor and the fox that are flying around .
O,Basically it's I make an argument for for the mundane it's the stuff that really matters the stuff that really drives happiness and this isn't just my opinion it's research backs this up .
O,It's it's very mundane things .
O,Good relationships with your family and friends having been good at something like working on something that you're good at feeling as though you're contributing to the people and community around you like it's really doesn't get much more complicated than that .
O,The second chapter of the book is called Happiness is a problem .
O,How does how is happiness a problem .
O,The argument I make is that to be happy you need to have problem because happiness is a byproduct of solving or overcoming problems .
O,And and basically that that whole chapter in a very core message of the book is that struggle pain and struggle are necessary for happiness to exist .
O,And I think a lot of people . One of the first places that people get misguided is that they assume that happiness is a lack of problems it's by just not having any struggles in their life or avoiding all the struggles in their life . And actually the opposite is true .
O,I mean you've had .
O,If we can bounce over to you know your career you've you started blogging pretty early on right .
O,Yeah like 2007 2008 .
O,And then you gained a lot of traction in sort of the dating approach kind of community right .
O,Yeah .
O,How does a person move from kind of guiding people to become better out with women than to know that what you're doing now .
O,So what happened was I started back in 2008 I read so I read the four hour work week by Tim Ferriss .
O,And I was like sweet that sounds easy .
O,I'll start a website .
O,And I started a few websites .
O,And what I quickly learned is that making money online is extremely difficult and requires an insane amount of work .
O,But one of those Web sites I created I created I tried to create a number of online businesses around my own interests .
O,And being a 24 year old single guy at the time was like cool I'll start a blog about dating .
O,And the first few years it was very is a very generic site you know it was the Articles were things like oh three things to do on a first date you know like how to get her to call you back .
O,You know it's a shit that you would see on Cosmo basically .
O,And and the funny thing is that as the years went on I kind of I started to get a lot deeper and more personal with the stuff that I wrote about .
O,And as I did that people responded in readership started to grow .
O,And by 2011 or 2012 to my surprise I discovered that a large percentage of my readers were actually women .
O,So I had I was writing this dating advice site for men .
O,And whereas I had started out talking about like first dates and text messaging . But after a few years I kind of entered into this place of talking about identity self-worth honesty vulnerability all of these like very kind of heavy psychological topics that I felt were being discussed in the men's dating world or just by men in general that I felt like needed to be addressed and it started attracting a lot of women to it .
O,That's surprising .
O,Yeah I was very surprised and I started actually sending .
O,So my first book is called models attract women through honesty and a lot of these women were telling me that like your date your advice is great not just for men but for for us too .
O,And so I actually started sending a number of women models and I was like Can you read this and tell me if it's good .
O,Oh yeah .
O,Like if this makes sense and if this actually applies to you .
O,And so some women started reading it and they all came back and they're like yeah actually this is even though this was written for men it's better dated advice than I've ever seen in any woman's book .
O,And so I started asking myself I'm like oh well why the hell am I just writing for men .
O,So in two thousand 13 early 2013 I rebranded the website relaunched everything to be gender neutral and just talk about life issues in general
O,and the other thing too . The other thing that kind of drove it is that dating advice people who struggle and they're in there with dating and relationships their perception of their problem is something very simple .
O,So their perception is like oh like men never call me back after the first date or you know women are they like to be my friend but they're not sexually attracted .
O,But once you actually start getting deep into the problem it turns out that really it's it's a very real problem underneath their dating problem is actually just a general life problem .
O,You know it's there their lifestyle or their identity isn't completely sorted out for themselves or that they have trust issues or they have a lot of sexual shame that they need to deal with .
O,And and the symptoms the things that they thought were the actual problems are actually just symptoms of some sort of deeper problem .
O,So I wanted to write about those deeper problems of men how they apply in life just in general .
O,I mean it seems like that it happens a lot when I when there's a problem it's it's something actually deeper rooted that is actually affecting you know kind of my life output .
O,I mean one of the one of the chapters in your book is just the value of suffering .
O,It's called the value of suffering .
O,How does suffering help us .
O,It's kind of a general kind of question .
O,I make the argument in the book that pain exists for a reason .
O,I kind of go through this funny little biological summary of like why pain exists you know if you think of something as simple as like stubbing your toe or like or when you're a kid you touch a hot stove it hurts it hurts really bad .
O,And the reason it hurts is because it's your biology is way of teaching you not to do that again .
O,It's your biology is way of teaching you how to to learn how to how to do something different in the future or how to adapt .
O,And the same is true for psychological pain .
O,You know whether it's a breakup or a business failure or an insecurity or an anxiety what these things really are is that there are psychological feedback there's a they are feedback coming from your brain telling you hey you need to look at this in a different way .
O,You need to try a different method or try a different approach to whatever you're doing .
O,And so in that sense it's it's actually pain is incredibly important .
O,And if we try to avoid it or forget it we're actually depriving ourselves of that ability to evolve and grow past it .
O,Yeah .
O,There's a great quote art that you say our lives hinge not on the ability to turn lemons into lemonade but learning to stomach lemons better .
O,It's basically learning the art of resilience because and look optimism is great .
O,I think people should be optimistic and positive thinking in a lot of situations .
O,It's good it's good to like say on the sunny side but I think and this is one problem I have with . Like a lot of the self-help world is that life just sucks sometimes like there's really no way around it .
O,You know it's like if my dog dies there's nothing good about that .
O,There's no there's no silver lining there's no you know it's it just hurts and it sucks and a lot of things in life are like that .
O,And that I think that needs to be OK .
O,It needs to be OK to hurt because one like I said earlier like a lot of our biggest lessons and a lot of our strength comes from our ability to withstand a lot of this pain .
O,But but to it's we need to stay grounded in reality .
O,We need to stay realistic about what's going on around us so that we can make good decisions for ourselves and I think a lot of people when they get caught up in kind of this like delusional level of positive thinking they start ignoring or denying the reality around them .
O,Yeah I agree 100 percent .
O,I mean you talk about how growth is an endlessly iterative process .
O,We don't shift from being wrong to just being right .
O,It's kind of something that just builds and you learn that .
O,I mean it's what I say is we never go from being wrong to being right .
O,We go from being wrong to being slightly less wrong .
O,At another way I put it in the book is that problems are never permanently solved because the solution to one problem is the genesis of the next problem .
O,So maybe I have money problems and I solve that by going and getting a job .
O,Well the job creates new problems .
O,I have to deal with politics at work .
O,I have a really frustrating commute every morning .
O,My stress of the projects I'm assigned
O,and . And then my solutions to those problems will create the next higher level problems and so what I say is that the key to a good life is not getting rid of your problems . The key is actually just having very good problems
O,and that process of solving one problem in creating a better higher level problem . In my opinion that's that process is actually what brings a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment for our lives .
O,Yeah .
O,Do you think that I mean when you were when you were coming out with models and books like that .
O,I mean do you see .
O,Do you think that you were kind of polarized in your perception to kind of dick me .
O,Did you feel like there were people who either hated you or loved you
O,early on for sure .
O,I mean back when models came out the majority of the men's dating advice industry was . It was still your classic kind of like pickup artist stuff .
O,It was like do you got to like go bang at 10 and you know like show her this and say this to her and make her and stuff like that .
O,And so I knew when I when I was putting it out there that I was likely setting myself up for a lot of extremely harsh criticism but I I believe very strongly in the message of the book .
O,And so initially it was very polarizing and I got called a lot of funny names by certain people in the industry and by a lot of guys in the industry .
O,But I've been very happy that it seems that actually that book is influenced and altered the course of that industry I see not only is it one of the best selling books in that industry now but it's it's a lot of the other companies and coaches that exist and then an industry I think are taking a lot healthier stuff these days than they did say five six years ago .

O,You've had some pretty bold posts like on through your blog .
O,There's one called why everyone on the Internet is an asshole .
O,Then you talk about how kind of the Internet warps perception .
O,Let's talk let's talk about that a little bit .
O,Like how how do you feel about the way the Internet changes social behavior .
O,I am absolutely fascinated by this topic and I have been for a couple of years now and and look like I think I'm not . I'm definitely not anti I can't be anti Internet like it gave me my career but I think it's just it's interesting because as every new form of technology that comes out it makes our lives better and in so many different ways I think it also brings a new array of problems with it that we as a society or a culture have to like figure out how to surmount .
O,I think the interesting thing about the Internet is that because it's so globally connected and so anonymous it makes it extremely easy to objectify not just people but opinions points of view perspectives .
O,And when you objectify a person's perspective it is easy to just shit all over it and not not fear any repercussions or not have any sympathy for it .
O,And so in many ways this amazing tool that has given us access to more information and you know anybody in the human race has ever had has also made it easier for us to indulge some of our worst instincts and to be a more judgmental and close ourselves off
O,one of the main points that you make in in this post is you talk about how confrontation has no negative social consequences .
O,And yeah that's obviously true .
O,I mean how it to I mean how how has it changed for you . Like moving from kind of this Internet based persona into kind of a real life thing .
O,It's been interesting .
O,I mean I think one thing that kind of growing up so to speak as a writer on the Internet is that it's it's really I feel like it's really made me impervious to criticism .
O,There's been a lot of funny just like small moments over the last couple of years working with my editor my agent and people at Harper where they'll be like little things or like they'll get really worried that like my ego is getting bruised like you realize how many people have like told me to kill myself go through email over the last five years .
O,Though I this is totally fine this is not a big deal .
O,So it's weird it's made me it made me jaded which I think has it's both it's it's it's pros and cons
O,on the one and I think I'm much more impervious to maybe a lot of things that a lot of authors go through when they're publishing their first book .
O,But on the other hand I think I'm more cynical .
O,I'll get a lot of offers which is unfortunate .
O,I can definitely understand that .
O,I mean as as this show has kind of grown I mean it it's like the hate mail that we get . I just it just doesn't affect me as much anymore .
O,Just after a while it just doesn't get to you as much .
O,Yeah and there's a weird thing and I don't know if you've experienced this but there's a desensitization on both sides of the spectrum which is the hate mail doesn't bother me as much anymore but when I get those emails where people are like Oh my God you changed my life .
O,Thank you so much .
O,You know I still appreciate it but I feel desensitised you know like five years ago whenever I received an email like that it was like it made my old day .
O,Yeah .
O,Oh my God this is this is incredible .
O,But now it's like sweet dude .
O,Thanks .
O,Good luck .
O,You know it's not even you know I'm not been honest though because it's what you're just bombarded with so many messages both positive and negative from so many people that after a while it becomes hard to really invest a lot in in any of them .
O,Absolutely I was . I was actually just having this conversation with a friend of mine the other day and when we first started out when we would get an email saying something like you just said that you know the shows change my life . It made my day
O,and now I mean not to take away from anyone who sends me an email like that to us but it's not you know it doesn't .
O,I'm grateful for it and happy for it but it just you know that that desensitization that occurs on both . It does occur on both ends of the spectrum
O,though where you talk about there is another post that you did called the pyramid scheme of positive thinking .
O,How does that work .
O,Oh yeah yeah .
O,So the the articles is the staggering bullshit of the secret .
O,Right .
O,That's right .
O,That that was the main article Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,The pyramid scheme is a section of
O,I knew I knew I had written somewhere but I was like I'm sure the articles not called that .
O,It's funny I actually just so I just did . I just got off another call before I got on with you and I was talking to this guy and if he was interviewing me he's actually is a speaking agent and we were talking about the positive thinking thing and he was saying that he doesn't take clients who do that sort of thing that look that's sort of like motivational speaking type stuff right .
O,And he said that he told me you said he literally had this conversation once with one of these types of motivational speakers .
O,The motivational . He said what what . What is your goal with doing speaking events like what is your goal to get across to the audience .
O,And the guy was like Well I want to inspire them to do great things in the world .
O,And because the world all the world needs is people to be more inspired and the speaking Asia is like well I actually think we should probably like figure out how to cure cancer or AIDS .
O,So why don't you work on that and the guy was like Oh but I can inspire people to cure cancer AIDS every ever go . The guy was like Okay so but then what do these people end up doing .
O,You know these are these people in the audience usually turn around and they they decide that they want to be a coach and they want to go inspire people and so you get this kind of this really funny pyramid scheme of and this happens a lot in the online world of of people who for instance people who will like teach a course doto create a course on the Internet that teaches people how to create courses on the Internet and people will think people would take the course and a no go create courses on the Internet teaching other people how to create courses on the Internet and you see this in all sorts of different ways .
O,You know people I've met people who are life coaches who the majority of their clientele they're teaching how to become life coaches and it's just this crazy thing that just it's pervading everywhere and I think and a lot of what enables it is this idea that simply feeling good is good enough you know it's like if I can just say a bunch of stuff that people in my audience will be like Wow it feels great .
O,And then tell them to go tell all the people it'll just keep getting passed on and you know what I guess where I put my foot down both in the book and on my site is like no feeling good is not good enough if you want to feel good just go like snort some cocaine or something like that .
O,There needs to be a higher standard to a good life than simply just feeling good all the time .
O,Brian Yeah man I mean I I really find it interesting .
O,I mean the industry is definitely intriguing to say it slightly .
O,I mean it does feel like a pyramid scheme and it did .
O,It seems like it kind of wraps you in .
O,And you know like you you need to keep going back for more .
O,It's almost like a drug .
O,I find your career fascinating because you you went from you know this sort of dating aspect to this . It's not self-help but it is
O,weird . I mean where did this formula come from .
O,Like what . What else are you doing .
O,Where do you say that your content is is hitting the most right now .
O,It tends to be oh so I jokingly say you know when I meet people and in real life and they say like oh what do you do .
O,And I'm like oh I'm a writer and like well what do you write .
O,I say I write self-help for people who hate self-help and it's funny because so many people I meet are like I think I would love to you know like I think I think that desire to improve your life is a pretty universal one .
O,I think everybody if they're being honest with themselves like wants to have a better life and and achieve more and be more successful and feel better about themselves .
O,But I also think there's a lot of people especially in the younger generations like you know say 35 and under who just kind of sense that a lot of this stuff you know a lot of the self-help stuff from the 70s 80s and 90s that it's kind of B.S. It's not really not very authentic it sells well but it's it's cheesy .
O,And so I think those are the people I'm hitting .
O,It's like this is I'm offering a viable alternative .
O,All right .
O,It's not just the same old clichés over and over again .
O,So then you would say that that your content is hitting towards the self-help industry or is it still with the dating stuff .
O,Oh it's definitely self-help stuff .
O,I mean it's at this point the dating relationship I think is a minority portion of my audience but yeah it's weird it's like a weird self-help .
O,I mean it's technically self-help but I kind of like go against the grain . Yeah in a lot of ways .
O,So there is one thing that you just in my notes is that you know you you started out and when you when you were kind of starting out you you were approaching like these these agencies to publish your stuff like these online like huffing . Huffington Post into like that now they're coming to you you're being interviewed by by Forbes and CNN and vice and
O,I mean how does how does that switch feel for you .
O,I mean at first it was a little bit of an ego boost .
O,Right .
O,Like it's it's suddenly all these publications I was practically begging like you have my work to get more exposure . A few years ago you know a few years later that suddenly they're knocking on my door .
O,So that always feels nice Like I think anybody can relate to that .
O,It feels like a little a little victory for yourself .
O,But it's funny it's funny to me it's if I stand back and kind of remove my myself from the equation I think it's it's a little bit representative of the weird place that the publishing industry is in because of the Internet .
O,It's like you .
O,Yeah .
O,Oh yeah .
O,On the one hand anybody can start a blog and start publishing on the Internet and that's great . But the truth is is that you know that you have to the people who control what gets spread around the most they still they kind of have to have control in it .
O,And it's a situation of the rich get richer .
O,So back when my articles weren't read by many people you know like Huffington Post in one of anything to do with me .
O,Then suddenly I start having some hit articles and develop like a really big fan base .
O,And now it's Huffington Post wants to publish any everything I write .
O,So it's yeah it's just it's a weird dynamic and I don't know how I feel like there needs to be like I don't know the publishing industry she needs to sort itself out in a lot of ways .
O,And one of the ways is that there needs to kind of be a clear path . Again you go from like an unknown nobody to like getting your work disseminated pretty widely .
O,Like right now it's not very clear how that happens .
O,You just have to like try dozens of things and hope one of them
O,has that has has this whole process like affected your sense of I mean . And like you have one hundred thousand readers five or ten thousand in a million and then two million and you mean you're just has this affected your sense of success .
O,Yeah it's been weird and this is actually one of the inspirations . For the book is that I always dreamed of a lot like a lot of the stuff that's been happening to me the last couple of years .
O,It's literally what I dreamed about when I was starting out like you might in my mid twenties .
O,And it's interesting that it doesn't feel the way you expect it to .
O,I mean it's great .
O,I mean it it's there's no way I could ever complain about anything that's gone on the last couple of years but it's it's weird because it doesn't it doesn't feel as good as you expected to feel the benefits aren't as good as you you expected them to be .
O,The problems are bigger than you expected them to be .
O,It complicates lives life in ways that you didn't expect .
O,And so experiencing a large success like that is it's actually a very strange .
O,It's a very good experience but it's a very complicated experience and this kind of being the first really big success in my life .
O,It was very disorienting at times is very strange and it kind of made me start asking like does it really matter like two million people read me or if it's like a hundred thousand .
O,Does this really make because at a certain point it just doesn't even feel real anymore like the difference the difference between a half a million and two million like it doesn't even feel real .
O,It's it's all just it's just a digit you know .
O,And and so it started really getting me to ask myself a lot of these questions about can I talk about the book which is just like what actually matters here .
O,Like what is what is actually driving my life and what should actually drive my life .
O,And and it kind of put me into these like little mini existential crisis for a little while as I started writing the book and that's kind of a lot of like where this these ideas came from .
O,Yeah I can I can imagine man .
O,I mean it's it seems like I mean these are all pretty healthy questions .
O,I mean did you do you happen to kind of go stoic with this or I mean there's a little bit of Buddhism in this to kind of label it and I mean how how did you get to a point where you were like OK well you know the value of suffering and you know we kind of reframing positive positive thinking and I mean like like what was what was the driving factor .
O,Was there any certain philosophy that you were kind of modeling
O,by I was very big into Zen Buddhism when I was in college and it's interesting I kind of got a weight when I graduated I kind of got away from it but like that's like my roots is a Zen Buddhist background and going through my 20s I was very highly motivated by a lot a lot of very conventional goals .
O,You know it's like I wanted to have a successful business .
O,I wanted to have .
O,I wanted to own my own business so I want to have a lot of free time and want to travel world .
O,I want to have you know they watch amazing people and have amazing relationships and it was kind of what I was talking about at the beginning of the podcast .
O,I had a lot of goals based on more more more get more succeed more have more do more and that was great .
O,And then what happened is I started achieving a lot of those goals .
O,You know so I . I did . I did travel all world and I did see all these amazing places and I did have a bunch of amazing experiences and I did build a successful business and I became a successful writer .
O,And it left me like I said in that kind of like that weird state of existential crises like oh what does this all mean .
O,You know what .
O,Why none of this matters what are what have I doing with my life .
O,And actually I noticed that a lot of that Zen stuff came back started coming out .
O,You know I always tell people that my writing is it's my own form of therapy for myself .
O,Like everything I write . It's not that like I know all the answers and I'm telling everybody else what to do .
O,It's literally like I have the same question .
O,And so I'm trying to write my way out of it .
O,And so as I was writing all this stuff I noticed that that the Zen stuff which is extremely similar to Stoicism it's all about zen and Zen they are .
O,They talk about a lot about not knowing and how how to get comfortable in a place of not knowing and you know Buddhism itself is very big on you know life is a form of suffering and you have to like detach yourself from your emotions and all the stuffs are coming out again and and it's funny because I guess I didn't really realize how big of an influence it actually had bet on me until recently .
O,Yeah it was there . I mean was there any single kind of like mentor or someone that you had influencing you through this process
O,not a specific person . No
O,I mean I've always had like writers and artists that I've looked up to as good examples like this sort of stuff that I want to do but yeah there's nobody I mean again the weird thing about internet publishing these days is like there's no real nobody's really figured it out yet .

O,Big fan fat a huge huge fan of David Foster Wallace and isn't particularly his nonfiction work . I think it's just like I mean his fiction is fantastic as well but it's nonfiction work is staggeringly brilliant .
O,Hunter S. Thompson Alan Watts is a big one .
O,I don't know if you're a South Park fan but there's a South Park episode called Simpsons did it and it's basically the entire South Park episode is like the kids keep coming up with these like crazy ideas and it's like every time they go out to start doing it it's like Oh no . Simpsons did it episode 28 and the whole the whole episode is basically just a joke of like every unique idea of the South Park creators have had The Simpsons already at it and I feel like that I feel like that like with Alan Watts it's like any like really powerful idea . I feel like I have it's like Alan Watts already wrote 50 years ago .
