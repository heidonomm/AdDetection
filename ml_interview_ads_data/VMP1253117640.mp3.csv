O,Lockdowns are being extended around the world .
O,"Ireland , Italy , South Africa , Malaysia , all looking to late April , early May at the soonest ."
O,"Meanwhile , President Trump has been pushing to reopen the country next month ."
O,It's worth noting that President Trump doesn't really have the authority to just open the country back up .
O,"The CDC has recommended people shelter in place through the end of April , but that's for states to decide , which is why a few states still haven't really even shut down yet ."
O,"Nebraska , they say antibody tests will be key to getting back to normalcy around the world ."
O,"Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation's leading infectious disease expert , says a large number of antibody tests should be available in the United States soon ."
O,"There have been problems with the accuracy of these tests , so I guess we'll have to wait and see ."
O,Another big part of getting back to normal is contact tracing .
O,Google and Apple are saying they're going to collaborate to use Bluetooth technology in their billions of devices around the world to tell us if we've come into contact with someone who has had this corona virus .
O,They say users privacy will be protected .
O,The feature is still a few months away .
O,Professional basketball might also still be a few months away .

I-AD,Now that's fair .

O,"Hi , my name is Sean , I'm calling from New York City ."
O,I am a relatively healthy twenty seven year old and I'm maybe the most anxious I've ever been in my entire life .
O,And I just I don't I don't know what to do about that .
O,I get that the response needs to be mitigating like actual real health impacts .
O,"For the most vulnerable section of the population , I get that ."
O,I really do .
O,But what can the rest of us do to just to feel OK ?
O,I don't know .
O,Has anyone thought about the kind of psychological impact of this crisis is having on the population ?
O,Thanks so much .
O,"Thanks for calling , Sean ."
O,"The answer to your question is yes , your boy as recline has been thinking about the psychological impact of this crisis ."
O,He wrote a whole bang piece about it for Vox.com .
O,I think in politics we're very used to looking at the economic impacts of things .
O,What is it going to do to GDP ?
O,What is it going to do to the unemployment rate ?
O,"But what coronavirus is doing is disrupting something more foundational and fundamental even than that , it is disrupting whether or not we are able to see each other , to give each other a hug , to go visit a parent ."
O,"And there's been a revolution in recent years in the medical science around social isolation and loneliness , which are different things , notably social isolation is objective , measurable ."
O,How many people do you see in a week ?
O,Loneliness is subjective .
O,It is within it .
O,"You feel lonely , but both of them have mental effects on people and they really do physical harm ."
O,They are a genuine health risk .
O,So understanding that and then trying to abate it .
O,"Recognizing that we have to do more than just physically distance , we also need to socially connect , particularly for the most vulnerable ."
O,I wanted to write this piece because I think it's unbelievably important .
O,Other numbers on social isolation are as bad as these jobs numbers are saying .
O,We don't do it in a national way .
O,moment-to-moment the way we do for the economy .
O,It isn't that there are daily unemployment filings for loneliness .
O,"Yeah , but we do have surveys and we do have a lot of data on this ."
O,"By coincidence , just a couple of months ago , the National Academy of Science released a huge report on the health consequences of social isolation and loneliness in older adults ."
O,"As you might expect , older adults are among the most vulnerable to this ."
O,So 43 percent said they felt lonely and about a quarter fit the definition of socially isolated .
O,And this is pre coronaviruses .
O,This is pre coronavirus .
O,"And remember , you may be millennial or a genze or whatever who's socially distancing right now , but if you're over 70 , you're doing something in most parts of the country ."
O,"If you're paying attention , that is much more severe ."
O,You're quarantining .
O,"You are terrified of catching this , not because you might give it to somebody else , which is bad enough , but because you may not survive it ."
O,"So a lot of people who are already quite lonely , quite isolated , have moved in to a period of self-imposed quarantine ."
O,That does not have a clear end point .
O,"And the more that young people go out , the more that their children or their friends are out in the world and potentially able to catch this virus the more they have to segregate away from them ."
O,"So it's really , really difficult ."
O,"And loneliness and isolation , particularly among the elderly , is a tremendous health risk ."
O,It seems to be physical in some deep way and the particular way in which it's physical .
O,"The former Surgeon General , Vivek Murthy , has done a lot of work on this ."
O,He's got a book coming out on it is that it sets off a tremendous stress response to the body .
O,"Human beings know on a deep level , deeper than our conscious heart to feel safe in a group ."
O,"If we are not in a group , we wake up more often during the night ."
O,We are more afraid .
O,"We are what's called hyper vigilant , reconstitutes scanning for threats ."
O,We don't relax .
O,And this seems to then set off a chain reaction of very dangerous actual physical reactions in the body .
O,"So in this National Academy of Sciences report , what they find is social isolation and I'm quoting here has been associated with a significantly increased risk of premature mortality from all causes ."
O,And this causes include a 50 percent increased risk of developing dementia .
O,A 29 percent increased risk of incidence of coronary heart disease .
O,A 25 percent increased risk of cancer mortality .
O,"A 59 percent increased risk , a functional decline and a 32 percent increased risk of stroke ."
O,"Now , that is over time ."
O,It's not nearly over two or three weeks of being lonely .
O,"But if this goes on for a long time , it is worth being clear ."
O,"Being lonely and being isolated is a health risk , a direct physical risk to your life ."
O,I'm sure there are some people who are fine being alone .
O,I know a few people who seem happier in quarantine than they were going to work every day .
O,But what about people who already suffer from serious anxiety or depression ?
O,People who are already desperately lonely ?
O,This is a huge issue .
O,I think so .
O,The way I would think about this is that the people who are already at the highest risk for social isolation and loneliness are even more vulnerable in this era .
O,"So we've been talking about the elderly , but the disabled are another group here , a lot of people who is already hard for them to go out , already hard for them to go take a walk ."
O,Already hard for them to see people for one reason or another .
O,"And then people with serious mental health issues who are socially anxious , who are depressed ."
O,"This is going to make it much harder both for them to go out , but also harder for people to reach out to them ."
O,"They may have an extreme reaction where they have trouble even taking incoming help , even if people are trying to be safe about it ."
O,"And I want to be so clear , we need to do the social distancing ."
O,We absolutely need to .
O,But we also have to remember that the cost of social distancing will fall disproportionately on those who are already most vulnerable and already were the most lonely and isolated .
O,"And that will have not just psychological , but also health effects for them ."
O,I'm doing OK .
O,My hair is a wreck because I have figured I'm not going anywhere .
O,Is it a closet or a thing ?
O,My name is Darcy Kelly .
O,I'm 84 years old .
O,I live alone and I'm pretty much in isolation .
O,It's really hard to just be stuck in the house all the time .
O,I like to be with people .
O,I miss that .
O,And I've seen my daughter on Saturdays from a distance .
O,She brings me groceries and leaves them in the garage and tells me not to come past the kitchen door .
O,"And the same with my daughter in law , who she leaves stuff on her front porch and doing Duolingo on my i-Pad in Italian mercy to keep my brain active ."
O,And then reading a mystery book .
O,And then I keep playing outside of drawers to find 84 .
O,And I've got so much stuff accumulated .
O,You can imagine then that's basically it .
O,"And watching movies that I recorded in the evening or as TV shows , I like Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune ."
O,So I record them .
O,And I don't even know what face time was .
O,So last week when the phone started making noises and I answered it as much fun doing on .
O,"So I said , how do you do that ?"
O,So he explained it to me .
O,So luckily for cell phones and text messages and stuff like that .
O,And based on with my family .
O,So that's good .
O,"I'm looking out my window right now and the trees are starting to bloom all over the place and the birds in the morning are , I guess I don't know , there's such a thing as a corona virus and they're all singing and building their nests in the trees or in my house ."
O,It's so funny to hear them singing and being happy .
O,"I miss being able to hug my grandson , who's nine years old ."
O,I have five grandchildren .
O,He's the youngest .
O,"And I just miss the closeness , you know , being able to hug somebody and have somebody hug me and which I always did with my family ."
O,"We're huggers , so I miss that ."
O,Yeah .
O,My advice to other people there are in my position is to keep busy with your mind .
O,Do something .
O,Want something pleasant ?
O,Read a book that's interesting and try to stay positive is the main thing .
O,"And I think , you know , I was in my position has to think like that has to be positive ."
O,"Otherwise , they may as well just , you know , curl up and die ."
O,I think I'll take as .
O,People have died from depression .
O,Just be sad .
O,"So you just gotta keep thinking positively that this will end , hopefully ."
O,I just hope it all does end yet .
B-AD,This is advertiser content .
I-AD,"As a journalist , I'm part of the problem ."
I-AD,We reduce people to one minute 14 news packages .
I-AD,I've done it .
I-AD,I've done it myself about my own people .
I-AD,"Newsrooms are tasked with covering the whole world , but they don't represent it ."
I-AD,More than three quarters of all newsroom employees in the US are white and three out of five of them are men .
I-AD,This has an impact .

I-AD,Right .
I-AD,And I'm the brown people .
I-AD,And it would be presented to us as fact .
I-AD,So the course correction podcast is basically my attempt at trying to change things .
I-AD,"A classic journalism trope is the view from nowhere , a single journalist , certain of their impartiality , presenting information as fact ."
I-AD,"But there's always a view from somewhere to now offer that personal experience is a feature , not a bug ."
I-AD,We all come with a set of biases .
I-AD,"It's about taking personal responsibility , not just as an individual , not just as me , a person , but as a journalist to report accurately and truthfully be a part of the conversation for change ."
E-AD,Listen to a course correction wherever you get your podcasts .

O,"Azra , we heard from Dorothy , who's learning Italian on Duolingo and getting the hang of face time , keeping her mind busy ."
O,Is this on us to figure out for ourselves ?
O,"Or is there something like , I don't know , the government could do to help or what ?"
O,"To be fair , it is a hard thing for the government to do anything about ."
O,This isn't one where you can easily imagine a policy that will solve it .
O,We are right now in a tension between our public health policy of social distancing and trying to keep the economy going .
O,"One of the ways I've been trying to think about it , and I saw this going around on Twitter is I wish we had message this as physical distance and social connection ."
O,We need to be more physically distant from each other .
O,"But at the same time , we need to be doing more , not less , to reach out ."
O,We need to be calling the people in our lives who are vulnerable .
O,We need to be setting up ways to call the people who don't have people in their lives to call them .
O,"As some doctors mentioned to me when I was working on this piece , by definition , the people who are most at risk are the people who are not going to have a social network that activates in this moment ."
O,"They are the ones who don't have kids , are going to make sure to call them every day or twice a day ."
O,I've really up to the amount I'd face timing my son in with his grandparents and my parents .
O,But a lot of people don't have that .
O,So what are we doing for them ?
O,"That is something where I guess in theory , the public sector , but also civil society could activate ."
O,Right .
O,That's a good app people can work on .
O,"And by the way , that's another thing that there's going to be a digital divide among seniors here ."
O,I was talking to some seniors who are having real loneliness and isolation issues .
O,I'm already from coronavirus .
O,But the seniors I'm talking to are the ones were able to get in touch with Fox .
O,Right .
O,"And they were saying that a great thing for them is they learned in recent years or at some point in the past how to use computers , how to connect digitally , how to use Skype ."
O,But older Americans are the ones who are least likely to be heavily online .
O,"And so for a lot of folks who haven't built a comfort and a confidence or even haven't bought the hardware that lets you have these kinds of digital connections , a lot of the ways the rest of us are trying to manage this era of social distancing are not there for that ."
O,They can't easily join a Xoom with all of their friends because they don't know how .
O,"So even as helping older people in your hiph set up and become comfortable with the digital solutions here that are a partial replacement for in-person connection , that can be really useful ."
O,"But beyond all the Zoom's and the face times and the House party , abso- , whatever ."
O,"At issue here , especially with the elderly , is that they may not have a social network to begin with ."
O,Right .
O,You're saying we need a totally new solution or app or something that could connect people who are free and willing to talk with those who are desperate for connection ?
O,Right .
O,Like .
O,"I don't know , maybe like a Chatroulette , but without all the Purvinas ."
O,That's a good .
O,I like chat roulette with that .
O,"Yeah , I like Chatroulette ."
O,"But for helping older people combat loneliness , does that app exist or do we need to make that app ?"
O,I think that is a good idea .
O,If anybody's out there and wants to make it and hopefully somebody has .
O,But I want to say that one of the ways coronavirus is an unbelievable .
O,Asshole of a disease .
O,Is it ?
O,"In addition to the direct death and sickness that it is causing , it is causing tremendous economic and social disruption ."
O,It is rending the very fabric of our lives .
O,"And something that I'm trying to add to the list of just what we are thinking about is the possibility if some of the more grim cases are correct and we are social distancing and in pretty significant ways , let's say through the end of the year , what are we going to do to connect people ?"
O,"But you and I spoke earlier about how you've been face timing more with your parents so they can see your son , their grandchild ."
O,"Then , like I gotta say , as a pathological , keep her in touch ."
O,I've been pleasantly surprised to see friends who've never called me or face time me calling and face timing now .
O,And I just use that House party app last week for the first time and it was utter and total chaos .
O,But I appreciate that a buddy organized it .
O,"I don't know if we have any like actual data yet , but is there a chance that this , you know , cross continental quarantine changes the way we communicate with our loved ones ?"
O,"I mean , fewer means and links and photos and maybe deeper conversation about how we're really doing and how we're feeling ?"
O,I do think so .
O,And I also think it's going to go in all different directions for people at all different times .
O,So I want to know two things that are a little subtle here .
O,I spent some time with Vivek Murthy .
O,"We did a great episode on on my podcast actually about loneliness and something that is in his book and in other work is this idea that when people are lonely , they are touchier ."
O,They experience more things as a slight .
O,Right .
O,They weren't called .
O,They're going to be scared .
O,They're going to be anxious .
O,Are going to be angry .
O,Right .
O,They're going to need somebody to talk to .
O,They'll be a freaking out about something .
O,And then you call and now they're ranting at you .
O,And you just called to have a nice conversation .
O,"And then on the other hand , there are gonna be people and I've definitely felt this myself ."
O,I'm in a house with .
O,I'm here with my wife and my wonderful but totally nuts 1 year old son and two dogs who are cooped up and not getting enough exercise .
O,And I'm not always the best version of myself either .
O,"And so as much as I want to be out there connecting and trying to be a good Samaritan on all this , sometimes I'll call somebody and I don't get the reaction I'm hoping for ."
O,And I don't have some of the emotional bandwidth to deal with it .
O,And so I'm finding it really important to be mindful that good intentions aren't enough .
O,You also just have to recognize it's gonna be hard for everybody .
O,We're gonna have to be really generous with each other and try to find the times when there is space .
O,You need to create space to do this kind of reaching out .
O,"Actually setting aside an hour a day so you can like take ten deep breaths first and then beat a good place to talk to people is difficult , but in the same way as everything else in this crisis , if we have the bandwidth for it is something that we have to do in a pro-social way ."
O,It's a way we can come together and show solidarity .
O,We don't just need social distancing and a very deep way .
O,"We need a commitment to solidarity , social solidarity ."
O,"Ezra , thank you so much ."
O,Maybe we can have you back to talk about this once someone makes Chatroulette without the Purvinas .
O,"Once they do that , I'm not going to come back because I'm to be on Chatroulette so much having great socially connecting conversations ."
O,Ditto .
O,"As Reclines aforementioned podcast as the Ezra Klein show , I'm Sean Ramiz firm ."
O,This is Today explained .
O,"The team is working remotely in Maryland , Virginia and Washington , D.C. but we still make time to check in every morning ."
