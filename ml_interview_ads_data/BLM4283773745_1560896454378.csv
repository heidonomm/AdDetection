O,This week on the podcast .
O,I have an extra special guest and what can I say about Professor Scott Galloway .
O,You know him from the floor .
O,He is an outspoken critic of various technology companies .
O,He says exactly what he thinks and feels he does not mince words .
O,He has a brand new book out called The Algebra of happiness that is already getting delightful reviews .
O,I read it over the holiday weekend and found it to be a pleasant and enjoyable romp filled with all sorts of good advices .
O,This is going to be a stocking stuffer .
O,Any dads and grads present for some time to come .
O,I can babble for a long time explaining to you what's in our conversation but rather than do that I'm just going to say with no further ado my conversation with Scott Galloway .
O,Our special guest this week is our returning champion .
O,Our first four time Masters in Business . Guest you know him from his book The Four Amazon Apple Google and Facebook and how they're destroying the world .
O,He is a professor at marketing at NYU Stern School of Business .
O,His latest book The Algebra of happiness just came out to great reviews .
O,Professor Scott Galloway welcome to Bloomberg .
O,Thanks very great to be here .
O,And you are a returning champion .
O,You are our first four time guest at least here in the studio and you are the first person I think I've had on consecutive books .
O,No that's not true .
O,I've had a few people four consecutive books so let's start .
O,Yes with a little background .
O,You wrote the Four .
O,It was effectively a class you were giving it .
O,And are you looking at marketing and technology or else about that .
O,Sir the dirty secret of business school is that the second year is mostly a racket to try and get double the tuition because you really just need the first year .
O,And by the way that's the same racket with law school you really only need the first two years to the third year is gravy
O,50 percent more revenue for us one hundred zero revenue
O,in my belief is that if we honest we would focus on the kids economic security we would teach for courses the second year Amazon Apple Facebook and Google .
O,Because to understand those four companies is to understand media retail the economy society et cetera .
O,So I teach a session of my class called before I do a video on that class that gets a million views Moon book my most
O,by the way . That's how I found you was the Four Horsemen of the Internet .
O,I was one of your first videos .
O,You know I'm like Who is this guy .
O,This is really fascinating stuff .
O,Yeah .
O,That that's all I got at one point one million views approached by Penguin Portfolio Random House which rolls right off the top .
O,Great success .
O,It's encouraging when you're when your publisher can get their name right .
O,But anyways the most popular course is the last session and it's where I take a bunch of great research out there and some of my my own personal observations and experience and I try to distill best practices around creating an arc an arc of satisfaction into some algorithms and some equations .
O,And it's called the algebra happiness .
O,It's my most popular session did a video two million views boom next book .
O,And that next book is The Algebra of happiness .
O,Yeah .
O,So two million views .
O,How many of those are people in the United States .
O,How much of that is international .
O,Who is watching a video called algebra of happiness
O,so I get it . And this is where I get 70 percent male and about 80 percent of my audience is under the age of 35 .
O,So I appeal to young males and I write a lot of this through the lens of you know the individual that is just inherently you know kind of wrong when they show up and that as a white heterosexual male .
O,And that's you
O,that's me .
O,So but yeah I find there's an audience out there .
O,I have a cottage industry in coaching and counseling the sons of my friends who are entering the workforce .
O,But yeah that's it's meant to be sort of OK you think you come to business school for economic security what you're really here for is to develop the skills and domain expertise such You can lead a rewarding life .
O,And we go through these observations in the last class and the kids seem to respond to it .
O,So it's not about money it's not about the pursuit of more you know although you talk about that in the book there are some really poignant quotes that that stayed with me
O,every wealthy person I know measures their net worth in frightening detail .
O,This doesn't sound like happiness .
O,How much happiness does money really buy .
O,So there is a correlation between money and happiness .
O,Middle income people are happier than lower income people the affluent are happier than middle income .
O,But that's bad news .
O,There is a core correlation we live in a capitalist society .
O,I believe that everyone has a responsibility to be economically sustainable .
O,So bust a move towards economic security is what I tell our kids .
O,But once you get to economic security housing health care can absorb an economic shock can take nice vacations which according to most data most cities somewhere between 100 hundred fifty thousand dollars a year .
O,I think in New York to try closer to 750 thousand dollars a year .
O,But once you get to that point the correlation between money or incremental revenue or moneys and happiness flatlines .
O,Right .
O,So the key is at that point in your life once you get to economic security for fortune enough to get there the money additional money is an ink in your pen and that is it can write different stories .
O,It can make the current chapters burn brighter but it's not your story .
O,There's also a method billionaires are less happy than millionaires they're not . But they're no happier either .
O,So there's a real skill to saying at what point you stop howling in the money storm and take pause and say well what gives me satisfaction why am I happy because more money won't give you more satisfaction the terrible thing about a number is similar to what you know in that great Star Wars episode where Luke Skywalker is trying to convince Han Solo to rescue Princess Leia he says if you do this you'll get more money than you'd ever imagine in Han Solo rip responds Oh I don't know I can imagine a lot of money .
O,So if I said to you Barry I said All right what do we are goals when you were 22 or 25
O,you say well by now I would probably hope that I had a good relationship with my wife .
O,Some economic security some relevance professionally in good health .
O,And I'm gonna guess who you have most or all of those same
O,pretty much all four boxes
O,but you you also know how much you're worth or you know approximately how much you're worth .
O,And it's pretty easy to imagine to five and 10x that number .
O,Insurance is tough .
O,You can imagine 10x you can imagine double right now .
O,I can imagine 10 you can imagine that you're a smart guy you can imagine .
O,So and that creates you know it's easy to stay on the spinning wheel and or the hamster wheel and I think it's important that we have the discipline to say OK I need to at some point stop howling in the money storm if I'm fortunate enough to have met you know more than my basic needs and figure out what really is meaningful to me .
O,That's interesting .
O,I know that I've made a number of choices career wise where I've turned down more money that I knew was just going to be a miserable slog for what I think is a pretty reasonable lifestyle and a pretty I mean I work a lot .
O,You know my wife calls me gainfully unemployed .
O,I would be doing the same thing whether someone's paying me or not .
O,So there are choices you can make to not take the bigger higher paying but horrific soul sucking job .
O,And just pursue something .
O,I like to think we're making a difference in what we do that we're we're if we're not denting the universe like Steve Jobs at least we're having a positive impact on people .
O,Yeah well so I'll go in reverse order .
O,Steve Jobs denied his blood under oath so he could avoid child support payments .
O,When I was I was scared of a billion dollars
O,so you know we need more engaged fathers not a better damn phone .
O,But anyways .
O,Be that as it may .
O,So you brought up the notion of turning down money to pursue stuff that you would enjoy more I think serves a larger purpose .
O,All of that's important however however I think some of the worst advice that kids get at Stern we invite two types of speakers we have three speakers a week for luncheon speakers and it's either super interesting people are billionaires or we have decided that if you've aggregated a billion dollars you must be able to opine on almost anything including life spirituality you know you're you're the master of all things because you've aggregated a billion dollars
O,and they end with what I think is some of the worst advice or most of the time and that is they tell the kids all one thing and what does that one thing follow your dream follow your passion I go for it which is what you love .
O,Such incredible B.S. because the guy I'd tell people if someone tells you to follow their passion your passion it means you're already rich and the guy on stage telling you that is probably made his money in iron ore smelting .
O,So you have not exactly a passionate .
O,Here you go .
O,So what I think my advice to kids when I say kids young adults is find something your job isn't to find your passion your job find what you're good at .
O,One hundred percent and then invest the requisite grit perseverance frustration endurance around in the injustice that is called the workplace and become great at it and the accoutrements of being great at it economic security the respect to your colleagues the camaraderie you develop with people in the agency of greatness will make you passionate about whatever it is .
O,But the problem with telling young people to follow their passion is what ends up happening is work gets hard it does for everybody and they think well maybe I'm not successful here I don't love it so it must not be my passion I should move on .
O,No that's called work .
O,You can't hate it .
O,I hated investment banking and I was no good at it .
O,So that was a sign to get out .
O,But the idea that Jay-Z followed his passion and as a billionaire assume you are not Jay-Z .
O,I assume that like most 99 percent of people you don't have to find something you're good at .
O,Invest a ton of time and become great at it .
O,I have to reference a disclaimer you have fairly early in the book you write . I have no academic credibility or credentials to indicate I should counsel people on how to live their lives .
O,So why did you write this .
O,So this has been a journey of personal discovery we were talking about this OFF-MIKE .
O,I struggle from what I would loosely call mild depression and issues with anger and my sister summarized the problem perfectly a couple of years ago when I was speaking to her she said Why are you so pissed off all the time .
O,And when I look at my blessings and I look at my mood they don't foot to one another .
O,And I decided that I would do some research around what are the best practices around people who are able to take stock of their blessings and translate that to their mood and their satisfaction with their own life .
O,And there's a tremendous amount of great research out there .
O,There's best practices there's worst practices and I try and summarize them for the kids and turn it into a class .
O,But it's also been a great personal journey for me to try and figure out okay how can I ensure that I take that again my blessings for it to my mood .
O,So on that there's a huge body of research about the positive power of gratitude .
O,Everything you discuss said in the book .
O,How how does one live a more grateful life .
O,Well there's supposedly tricks and one of them is just writing them down .
O,Suppose we write them down this amount them but I think there's other things too .
O,I think with especially with men we have a problem communicating admiration and affection for other people
O,as young men especially when I grew up in the 70s and 80s affection meant one of two things you were trying to have sex with that person or you were a homosexual .
O,And in the 70s or 80s for a heterosexual man both of those things were considered either suspect or a bad thing right .
O,So himself changed .
O,Times have changed and I think affection if you look at mammals if you look at where we're happiest if you look at what we're meant to do we're pack animals and we're meant to touch each other now unfortunately because of just some outrageous and criminal behavior in the workplace . We've conflated masculinity with toxicity and we've said affection in the workplace is a bad thing .
O,And I understand that .
O,But I think men need to take back affection and be affection with their children expressive affection to their friends .
O,And the reality is it just doesn't take a ton of common sense to recognize when affection isn't welcome but affection is a wonderful thing .
O,And also just verbal admiration I bury I think you're an impressive guy .
O,I think you have a really interesting career and I love the fact that you talk about your hobbies
O,you just seem like you seem like a guy that would be a great mentor a great uncle the guy at people want to hang out with
O,saying that most men when they say that feel as if they're giving up something that admiration is a currency that when I say that that it somehow takes that away from me especially young men .
O,So what I encourage people to do our young men is to say look one of the greatest things that can take you off track is that don't assume that people in your life are telepathic thinking loving thoughts about your friends and family doesn't make you a loving person .
O,You have to express these things and the greatest untapped resource in the world is the good things you feel about other people that you don't articulate .
O,We assume that people telepathically understand that we admire them that we respect them that we're fond of them .
O,And I think the fastest way to increase your short term happiness is to find the courage to when you when you feel good things about other people to express them .
O,And quite frankly it's a little bit embarrassing .
O,You make yourself vulnerable .
O,Sometimes it can even be off putting to the other person .
O,But on the whole I think it's one of the greatest hacks to feeling more grateful and being more happy is just expressing all the good thoughts that run between your ears every day .
O,So you're suggesting an individual can decide to be happy and decide to be grateful can implement hacks in order to achieve that state .
O,So I think there are best practices and I don't think there is an equation .
O,And I also don't I want to I want to be I want to disclose that I think there's certain forms of depression in neuroses that require outside intervention
O,but there are through and there is no one equation .
O,So the title is a little bit misleading one happiness is a sensation .
O,We were talking about economy before when I'm really talking about as the decisions and investments you make through the course your life such that the arc or the narrative of your life is a little bit more satisfying and the highs and lows that we all experience swing on a higher plane .
O,So I don't think there's any one equation people have to find their own route but there are best and worst practices .
O,So the Harvard grand study largest study of its kind on happiness found worse than that .
O,Let me interrupt you .
O,They tracked 400 by 400 men over 75 years .
O,Yeah over 80 years .
O,And it's interesting started I think in the 20s and was it which gives you sort of insight into the way we thought about people most important in the 20s we decided to track 400 men right like who shows about women's happiness 19 20 isn't good .
O,And no women of course is surprised by that .
O,And we waited till we tracked them for 80 years that scientists tracked them for 80 years .
O,Everything that a what they did at work all of their relationships their sporting activity or lack thereof their media and then queried them on a regular basis their levels of happiness and satisfaction and then aggregated the largest data set on longitudinal happiness ever and then said What are the best practices among the people who are happiest or seem more satisfied .
O,What are the worst practices among people who seem least satisfied one .
O,And they had to swap out four principal scientists so let's start with the worst practice .
O,The one thing that was prevalent or consistent most often across the cohort where the lowest level of happiness .
O,And he guesses
O,alcohol
O,100 percent alcohol .
O,And that's surprised me by the way this is like what I call it .
O,Do what I say not what I do .
O,I love alcohol .
O,I feel as if I've gotten more out of alcohol than it's gotten out of me .
O,Great . Churchill quote
O,Although although you write in the book that in your 20s and 30s alcohol mess with you .
O,Yeah it did .
O,It did .
O,And I'll I'll come back to that but basically alcohol was seen in a lot of instances as ruining relationships taking people's health off track careers coming undone .
O,And what I when I look back when I first moved to New York in the 80s and I took a job with Morgan Stanley every night I'd go out and get pretty much you know drunk with other people that felt like they were successful at a cool place downtown and it had sort of this sort of call artificial relevance and fabulous ness to it .
O,And I found that over time I was less effective at work .
O,I lost touch with a lot of people I wasn't investing in relationships with my family and I decided after two years of that that I was just going to dial it back .
O,And the problem I find with young people is that their litmus tests are whether they have a problem of substances as they say .
O,Am I addicted .
O,Have I had an intervention .
O,Am I living under a bridge .
O,And if they have a job and they're well liked and they're doing well they think I don't have a problem with substances .
O,But it's not that black and white .
O,There are nuances here and
O,80 to 90 percent of substance abusers are functioning substance abuse .
O,The better question is If I dial down X Y and Z substances whether it's trans fats whether it's alcohol whether it's pot whether it's shopping would I just be better at a bunch of things .
O,And what I counsel my kids on are my students is take stock of every external substance and imagine you did a half two thirds 80 percent more because there's also I think this narrative it has to be 0 or 1 .
O,You either have to totally give it up or you don't have a problem .
O,Everything in moderation at
O,100 percent .
O,So but for me it was something where I felt a lot healthier a lot better .
O,And but yeah that's definitely the one thing they found happiness .
O,The best practice if there is a hack and of course a student someone to get to the one thing is they found that the cohort that was happiest it was pretty pretty straightforward .
O,It was based on the depth and number of meaningful relationships in their life
O,at work . Do you feel respected admired .
O,And do you respect and admire other people amongst your friends . You get a sense of camaraderie and joy and do they sense camaraderie and joy from you
O,and at home amongst your family do you feel an intense level of support and love and just as importantly do you know they feel that sense of love and joy from you
O,in this sense the Harvard Grant Study burned through four principal scientists because they kept trying over the course of those eight years summarize this 100 something page report and has the best opening line of any academic study to summarize the findings and it's the following happiness is love .
O,Full stop .
O,And that is the one thing we find across almost all these studies on happiness that it's their ability to invest in and maintain deep meaningful relationships across your friends and at work and at home .
O,Let's talk about those students and I want to reference something in the book that I thought was fascinating .
O,There is a chart effectively that looks like a smile that shows where people in their life cycle or happiness .
O,Sure
O,when they're young then when they're old .
O,Tell us about that .
O,Yeah it's difficult .
O,This is just gorgeous gorgeous data because across all studies and across cutting across ethnic groups income cohorts cultures we found are they find something very similar .
O,And that is people are generally happiest in the beginning and the ends of the lives and that is from zero to 25 .
O,It's the stuff of Disneyland your first car exploration of self spilling into adulthood football games you know just magic right .
O,And then kind of from 25 to 45 it's what I call the life gets real face .
O,And that as you find that you're not going to have a fragrance named after you you're likely not going to be a senator someone you love gets sick and dies .
O,Having children is stressful .
O,What's interesting we don't like to talk about is that when we survey or when they survey people with kids and with our kids on average the people with our kids are actually happier knocked out kids without kids .
O,That's surprising .
O,It is surprising how at the end of life people's consistently say we have a hormone that releases that erases the bad times and we feel more rewarding and more fulfilled . Having had kids but during it they're less happy .
O,It's stressful .
O,Kids are stressful they put economic pressure on you you know .
O,One of my favorite things is you know kids ruin everything .
O,Babies are awful and they get less awful but still it's kids are . Kids are difficult .
O,So you have and then you find that you face economic stress usually at some point in your life with the cycles and you find you wake up oftentimes sometimes 25 35 45 and you're disappointed .
O,We have a tendency to anchor off the most successful person we know we have a tendency to believe what college and our parents told us that we can be anything which is
O,this is why Facebook Instagram is so toxic .
O,Well it's especially toxic because again we have this wonderful competitiveness gene that ensures that the next generation will be taller faster smarter stronger .
O,And by anchoring and aspiring off the most successful person we do that has a very positive evolutionary benefit .
O,But it also makes us feel bad about ourselves .
O,And the thing about Instagram is that these people become somewhat relatable and to Boutin who I think is going to go down as one the more interesting thinker says envy is a function of familiarity so we don't empty the Queen .
O,We don't say I wish I were the queen .
O,I wish I were rolling around that carriage but on Instagram you not only see what you're missing out on .
O,You see it play out in real time amongst your friends .
O,And it's kind of their success is shoved in your face especially among young people who are unable to really to really modulate that .
O,But 25 to 45 are usually is usually your least happiest time .
O,And then something wonderful happens in your 50s and in your or younger if you're soulful and you start finding appreciation and joy in places you didn't find it before .
O,I used to surf when I was younger because I thought I was cool .
O,Now I'm kind of fascinated by the idea kicking me out then I would even call it surfing or more it's more McLean to a piece of fiberglass for dear life .
O,But the fact that several thousand tons will emerge because of the geometry of the sand floor and the way the sun feels and I mean you just you're just joyous ride
O,these small things that look like you called children become more joyous you maybe take stock your blessings maybe have a little bit economic security
O,you realize life is finite you appreciate your health you find joy in things you'd never find joy in nature or art and you get happier and the cohort that is happiest would logically be the cohort that should be the least happy and that's people who start to have their health fail and those seniors who are consistently the happiest .
O,So the advice here is simple in your 20s and 30s among people who are having a tough time and that is this is it this is a normal part of the journey .
O,And the key is to keep on keepin on that happiness waits for you .
O,Look let's roll back from the 50s 60s and later years to those 30s and 40s you write in the book .
O,This is the time of your life where you have to make your bones were you going to work hard .
O,I'm going to put in a lot of hours but you need to do that during those decades . So so the future in happiness arises .
O,Explain that .
O,So I survey the kids again the students about where how much money they expect to be making in 10 20 and 30 years and 90 plus percent of them expect to be in the top 1 percent .
O,So granted this is selection bias because the second year of business school in New York the average salary coming out of schools one hundred and eighteen thousand .
O,Right .
O,Which is a lot of money that already all but the median across the already puts them in kind of at eighty fifth or 88 percentile and they expect to be in the 90 ninth by the time they're 35 or 40 .
O,And my observation and I believe those data to back this up is that if you expect to be in the ninety ninth percentile balance is a myth and we all know somebody who's good looking in great shape has good relationships with their parents donates time at the ASPCA and has a food blog .
O,Assume you are not that person unless you're smart enough to inherit a lot of money if you expect to be in the top economic weight class . You should expect to do not much else other than focus on your career in your twenties and thirties .
O,And by the way I want to acknowledge that's not the road to happiness for everybody .
O,A lot of people say I'm not going to hell in the money storm I'm going to find a way to lower my burn and I'm not going to let money dictate my happiness .
O,We live in a capitalist society and most of the people we know have decided that they want a certain level of economic security and success and it has to be an honest conversation with yourself .
O,In my 20s and 30s I don't I don't know about you Barry .
O,I don't remember much else than working and I want to be clear . It came at a price .
O,I am bald .
O,I burned through my first marriage and I am not going to totally abdicate personal responsibility for those failures but I think a lot of it was the fact that for two decades I was very focused on economic security and not much else .
O,I think young people just have an honest have to have an honest conversation because we're told when we're young you can have it all .
O,Well I am sorry I'm not here with a message of hope .
O,It's difficult to have it all in there .
O,Everything is a trade off so I have a lot of balance now . As you do because I didn't have very much when I was young and that was a conscious decision I made
O,quite quite interesting .
O,So we talked a bit about technology .
O,Yeah
O,let's get into some of the details about this because your your previous book obviously delved into some areas you made some bold forecasts some of which were incredibly prescient .
O,You said a year ahead of time .
O,Hey Amazon should buy whole foods will give em a giant footprint blah blah blah .
O,And they did .
O,Were you at all surprised by this whole Amazon HQ debacle .
O,Well so look and I'm I'm boasting here but the beginning of 2018 I said this isn't a contest it's a con .
O,And that is I've been on seven public company boards a dozen private company boards and I've been to four headquarter relocations .
O,And in retrospect it all came down to one thing and that is where the CEO wanted to spend more time where he was he or she was president of their golf club or where his next wife was living .
O,When you are a 55 year old man with 155 billion dollars it means that you have more options than anyone in the world and you are the master of No .
O,So query me this a guy who is 55 or one hundred fifty five billion dollars .
O,Is he going to spend 12 minutes much less 12 weeks in Indianapolis
O,is the wealthiest man in the world going to decide to roll in Columbus Ohio and this is the sophisticated analysis I did bury
O,the Bezos have four homes one in Seattle one in L.A. one in the Upper East Side and one to Cal around a D.C. L.A. made no sense because they couldn't justify that close geographically would make no sense to have a headquarters is down the coast .
O,So I said on Fox CNN and CNBC this is all a ruse .
O,They had game five . This to extract a pound of flesh from municipal police fire and school departments and transfer it to Amazon shareholders but they have absolutely no intention of going anywhere but D.C. and New York .
O,And I was wrong .
O,It was both right you said D.C. or New York to D.C. or New York .
O,And I was wrong .
O,They picked both .
O,This wasn't a contest .
O,It was economy by the way while I'm on a river remember that terrible imagery that there were that kind of race baiting that Reagan engaged in the image of a welfare mother who had a welfare queen right .
O,Right .
O,The driving the Cadillac .
O,Yeah .
O,An individual gaming the system .
O,Right .
O,And taking our tax dollars for their own benefit .
O,The mother of all welfare queens is Jeff Bezos because he never sells a stock triggering a capital gain meaning he never ever leaks taxes never pays taxes .
O,So how does he finances lifestyle Barry .
O,He borrows money in one and a half to two and a half percent against his stock at JP Morgan and then 17 percent of every subsidy given to Amazon whether they located a data center or a headquarter goes into his pocket .
O,So if you looked at our economy with 20 trillion dollars 5 trillion government 600 billion goes the military or whatever is assuming that I'll go to Social Security and outflow is to the wealthiest man in the world .
O,Jeff Bezos is a is is literally the mother of all welfare queens and Alexa . Is this a good thing .
O,So let me push back on that a bit because I am no stranger to corporate welfare queens .
O,And to me the biggest offenders are the Wal-Mart's not the McDonald's .
O,The companies who have gained the system right .
O,The ones who figured out how to charge how to pay as little as they possibly can .
O,Then I've got Memphis since right .
O,Remember a couple of years ago McDonald's literally had a mic help line so that they could get their employees on food stamps and Aid to Dependent Children .
O,And when you look at the highest employers of government assistance on a state by state basis it's invariably Wal-Mart and and or McDonald's .
O,Now over the past five years they've improved a lot .
O,Know I can't blame Bezos for a not showing a profit by reinvesting their money .
O,They go purposefully or low profit company no profits mean no taxes .
O,And B if he chooses not to sell his stock again I can't push back too hard on that .
O,Yeah but the point that hey you the wealthiest men in the world this is one of the highest market cap one of three biggest market cap companies in the world .
O,Pay your fair share of tax on Amazon that that nobody can argue with .
O,So you said a lot there and I think at the end of the day we have to have greater minimum wage it hasn't kept pace with inflation .
O,And Wal-Mart and all of these companies should be probably paying more money and the government should be paying less to so of these people can survive .
O,I acknowledge the point .
O,Now whether or not it's what is worse having billions or tens of billions of dollars spread across low income people or the working poor or going out to the wealthiest man in the world I would argue that the latter is worse .
O,I don't think Jeff Bezos is doing anything wrong .
O,I think the man in the mirror the guilty party here is you and me who haven't elected officials who are smart enough to recognize that the markets have gone through a fundamental shift and when a company can become the third most valuable company in the world it is on its way to becoming the most valuable company in the world
O,when it can effectively pay no taxes because the markets don't demand profits or meaningful profits . We have an economic and taxation construct that no longer works for our society .
O,We can't have a functioning economy when the most successful company in the world . Amazon pays one point four billion in taxes since 2008 .
O,And Walmart has paid 64 billion remains .
O,I'm not saying they've done anything wrong but our economy can't operate
O,so even in France and we immediately think that any idea from anywhere else is socialist or stupid that we are . We have a monopoly on good ideas .
O,But France has basically said look we give up your tax lawyers are smarter than our tax authorities .
O,So we're going to tax you on your top line revenues .
O,Brazil is doing the same thing
O,in Britain . Google registers about 6 billion sterling in business every year .
O,And for the purposes of profitability and taxation they report a 50000 pound profit every year on a product that's got six billion dollars on signal 10 billion or so 10 billion seven and a half right .
O,What is that 127 say about seven point six billion .
O,Shocking .
O,And they've decided what they report to the government that can be tax is 50000 pounds and it's expensive to do business in London .
O,It's not that expensive .
O,So we're in a system now where when you have the most successful company in the world not paying taxes when you have companies that game the system and can avoid the you know avoid taxes by locating in the Isle of Jersey apples international headquarters is in a smile a small island off the British coast .
O,I mean this is this is arguably these companies are normally masters of technology are masters in business are masters of tax avoidance and we haven't elect the elected officials that they acknowledge and we'll counter what is a regressive tax and that is the most successful people the most successful companies pay less taxes
O,and taxation is largely a zero sum game which means the following . Small and medium sized companies have to pay more .
O,So we have basically said all right if you win the lottery in lower and middle income people effect hundred percent more .
O,So this is we have we have institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure
O,and that's problematic .
O,And to go to your point that Amazon headquarters search was a con today . Just today we learned that they're looking to take 50 or 100 thousand spay feet of space in Manhattan regardless their offices . So let's go and everything was just a nonsense a total Ruse Right .
O,It's all right .
O,They need to be at this location .
O,They need to have access to the talents or whatever else is here .
O,And the whole thing was just luck .
O,I think this reflects poorly .
O,I think this reflects that the board of Amazon and Jeff Bezos lack character and code because this was nothing but an elegant transfer of funds from municipal fire police and school districts into the shareholders pockets of Amazon shareholders
O,to their credit . Google and Apple are all both adding thousands of jobs in New York why we have three world class universities here .
O,It's a fantastic place to do business .
O,And you know what that comes at a cost
O,the worst poker players in the world . BILL DE BLASIO And in Governor Cuomo they were always coming here .
O,They were always coming here and even when they pulled out and said oh we're angry relating .
O,Well now they're coming here they're just doing it quietly because bottom line the wealthiest man in the world doesn't need to commute to Ohio .
O,He's not going to .
O,So let's talk about a couple of our other favorite tech companies .
O,I read something fascinating actually e-mailed you the story about we work and their new investment subsidiary that's going to buy the buildings that they're going to sell .
O,Now I haven't bought into we work as a Ponzi scheme although and I know you've said some harsh things about them .
O,But the idea that they're going to invest in the buildings that they then sublet to themselves starts to smell like old cheese a little bit .
O,Yeah .
O,It's so look the most overvalued private company until about two months ago was uber .
O,Mm hmm .
O,And they were claiming that they were worth 120 billion dollars .
O,Now they're not even worth 60 or 70 .
O,This company could execute perfectly and still be cut in half in terms of any reasonable maneuver .
O,We're talking about 100 percent .
O,Do you agree that they waited too long to go public and left so much value on the table because they got greedy or when looking behind .
O,I think that they should have never gone public in the private markets are now more amenable to companies like this an asset essentially here's a better prediction .
O,Everyone talks about his uber tests going out of business .
O,I think the Nasdaq and the NYSE are going out of business way better .
O,We'll come back to that rule rollback a sec .
O,Uber which has 30 of 40 billion in venture capital .
O,How do they not go public .
O,There's no exit for tons and tons of CEOs who weren't looking for 5 percent a year for a million years .
O,There's secondary markets now in the private markets there's liquidity in the private markets and never used to be not 30 billion dollars worth .
O,Not a whole not eight .
O,Yeah they raised eight .
O,That's a fair point they probably can raise a billion .
O,But there were secondary trades taking place there secondary trades right now and in stocks and in and you know you can buy shares in most private companies now is secondary .
O,There's liquidity .
O,Now again the retail investor who loses the retail investor now gets to buy stuff when it's totally overvalued and there's no other source of that kind of capital .
O,But going back to the most now the most without overvalued private company in the world is we work supposedly it's being valued at 40 billion dollars .
O,I think they did two billion in revenue and lost two .
O,I mean this and they have their own metrics I call it hey that's a 50 percent margin test and they call it community based EBITDA ratio .
O,And if you do the analysis and one guy I think maybe even your Bloomberg did the analysis and said based on this valuation the floor that we work leases is now worth more than the building
O,the whole building right .
O,So and you have you have a company sort of investing long taking out 10 year leases and then going short on its revenue .
O,Right .
O,Because which and that's the value is there are being a demand around short term supply .
O,That's downturn they're in trouble
O,huge trouble .
O,And even again if this company executes perfectly it's not worth I mean it's a Regis with IPA beer .
O,Remember Regis sure it's it's a cooler it's a great concept they built a great brand .
O,You know I think you and I could probably build a great brand around a two billion dollar business if were allowed to lose two billion dollars .
O,This company is a train wreck in terms of valuation really what's going to happen with the IPO .
O,Will there be an IPO that it'll be really interesting to see if we work and get out .
O,I wonder if the marketplace is starting to exit the consensual hallucination between unicorn status and all these B.S. words I'd like to do a word cloud across every prospectus and lift a newbie who saw things like networking effect flywheel effect autonomous driving .
O,First off there's no evidence that autonomous driving will be either good nor bad for Uber and Lyft .
O,It just means they don't have to pay the drivers they'll pay a little more for the car and they'll drive but quite frankly their economic advantage advantages they figured out a way to find four million people who will work for below minimum wage right .
O,That's not a good thing .
O,It's that what about what about four million cars for zero wage
O,but who garners the economic value there it'll be the engineers that create that technology album and why is that going to be uber and not Google which is the greatest concentration of IQ ever anyway .
O,I think you could argue both ways .
O,What's going to happen there .
O,What Uber has been able to figure out is a flywheel effect and that is has launched a new business on this incredible platform Uber reads because there is real value in Uber .
O,It's a global brand .
O,It's typically the first and the last brand the global affluent interact with when they're in a foreign city .
O,They've got tremendous data .
O,They've got a fantastic brand as culture of innovation .
O,There's a lot of things they could do there .
O,So if they execute perfectly they're only going to be worth what BMW is worth which is around 30 billion dollars of the stock's going to get cut in half .
O,The company that could go to zero if they don't get acquired is Lyft .
O,There is no network effect there .
O,There is no global brand .
O,There is no flywheel effect .
O,Really it's just a company hemorrhaging money .
O,You don't think that there will be space in the market for a number two to Uber is number one .
O,I don't .
O,Here's the thing about .
O,So it's easy to talk down stocks .
O,A company that I think is undervalued is Arabic maybe
O,because what you need with Arab BMV is you need local do you need local supply you need apartments in the same way with ride hailing you need local supply you need drivers in Cleveland
O,but with ride hailing all you need is local demand and that is you and I could start a ride hailing company here in New York and create demand and supply
O,with air BMV you need local supply but you need global demand .
O,That's the majority of people coming into Cleveland are from Scandinavia and Capetown and all all manner of cities around the world .
O,So they have extraordinary moat around their business .
O,But ride hailing has very few moats a low entry a lot of local players it's a price war .
O,They convinced the consumer that 20 dollars worth of service is worth 14 dollars .
O,They're not afraid to go after each other .
O,They have a decent amount of cheap capital .
O,This is going to get very ugly .
O,So left . I think that's either you know lift gets maybe blocked at some point but you can imagine lift going to zero .
O,There's real value in Uber real value maybe even 20 or 30 billion dollars in value but at 60 now I have a difficult time making the argument for how this company in any way justifies that type of job .

O,Welcome to the podcast .
O,Scott thanks so much for doing this .
O,I have to tell you I I plowed through the book over the holiday weekend .
O,Thanks Mary .
O,I found it like just a fun fast read .
O,It is literally sitting on the beach out in the Hamptons .
O,Nice and I really enjoyed it .
O,I'm shocked at how revealing you are in the book .
O,Yeah you you basically say here I'm naked warts and all .
O,That's a challenging thing to do .
O,Yeah .
O,What I found though Barrie is that when you when you're authentic and you try and be open about it like I'm very good at talking about my victories I can tell you pretty well
O,right .
O,So talking about my shortcomings and some of the things that I've struggled with .
O,What you find is there's a lot of people out there some that you know very well some strangers and they reach out and you find out other people struggle with stuff .
O,See I would be hard .
O,So I happen to know what a deep dark depraved person I am on the inside .
O,And I would be really mostly depraved .
O,I would be not that deep you but you're just mostly to to
O,the depravity has depths . That's what I was referring to .
O,But I would be sort of afraid for people to .
O,So I personally think I've come a long way .
O,But I think people would be shocked to know this sort of screw up I was in my 20s .
O,How come I mention where oh
O,first of all I don't know what to do with myself .
O,The functional families are the ones you don't know Barry
O,maybe in my 20s I know what to do with myself .
O,If you grow up on Long Island and you a Jewish male and you're Don't you know you don't have a purpose will you go to law school right .
O,Pretty much that's a grad school sports right .
O,A lead in the aimless .
O,That's exactly right .
O,And so by the time I got out of law school I knew two things I knew I was fascinated by the intellectual debate surrounding jurisprudence and I knew for sure I did not want to be a lawyer .
O,But it took me as a great education fantastic education arguably . I've made the claim that law school is a superior education to business school because at least the way business school used to be taught you know it would fill people's heads with how business should be run .
O,Whereas Law School teaches you how to think and also to write
O,100 percent .
O,And so you know I was a screw up in my 20s and even in my early thirties it took me till I was you know my wife kicked me in the button said figure out with how you're going to do and go do it you're sorta .
O,Don't kid yourself you're still a screw up .
O,Yeah like don't sell you're short you're you're quite a slut we're all trying to figure out the kids are you putting wants to one foot in front of the other and then hopefully along the way making small investments in relationships .
O,And one of the you know we talk about it as a finance show or business show you know we talk about the magic of compound interest put a thousand dollars a month a quarter a year when you're a young person you wake up and you have you know a couple underground you're older .
O,The same is true of relationships there's evidence that small investments when you're a younger person that are consistent .
O,A quick text message a call you know a note saying Hey I'm sorry I heard about this or congratulating people finding time for the reunion and finding time for weddings .
O,You wake up and when you've made those little investments you find that you have a lot of meaningful relationships or that you wake up and that meaning that relationships is more meaningful .
O,And so just as we tell young people to be disciplined about making short term investments or small investments as they're young I think all of us can start a war start right away and start making little investments across a broader set of relationships .
O,And then I think you do wake up one day and think wow there's a lot more in this bank than I'd ever imagined .
O,That does compound interest applies to relationships .
O,Most people when asked what is the single relation singular relationship in their life most say are across their mom .
O,Really .
O,And when you think about it why is that .
O,Some of it's instinctual .
O,But a lot of it is that your mom is the premier investor .
O,She began making little investments in you every day from a very very early point and you end up with a relationship that is singular when you're older .
O,And I think that's a lesson in the importance of not only investing and saving early but making an effort to make small tiny regular investments in relationships from a young age .
O,I'm going to tell you something that you did for me unknowingly .
O,You write about giving your mom a good death .
O,Yeah .
O,In the book and it's actually a very touching story in how you explain how significant that is to you personally .
O,So my mom is fairly healthy but she's 83 .
O,Don't live forever .
O,Oblivion beckons and early and it was something that wasn't actually from the book it ended up in the book .
O,It was from no malice . From your website you have no mercy no malice no mercy no malice and basically you talked about that maybe it wasn't the original post about your mom .
O,Yeah .
O,And it my mom is there's two promise from my mom .
O,She's a giant pain in the neck and I'm just like all the mom .
O,But no no .
O,But even worse I'm just like her I used to know I used to jokingly tell my wife .
O,Yeah you know I was born into a wealthy family just the wrong family took me home .
O,I really should have been you know royalty the wrong family took me home and she goes I've met your mother there's no way the wrong family took you home .
O,Yeah and the fact that I'm her clone .
O,Yeah .
O,And so I get to be irritated by all her habits that I have in spades .
O,Your your posting on that last year sort of softens how I interact with her for the better .
O,Yeah .
O,Look everyone has gotten a call love Hey but you know she installed all the buttons .
O,Not only does she know how to push your buttons to make you crazy she's the one who installed .
O,And just look at how your wife treats her parents you just like guys how come you're so impatient with them .
O,But anyways for me there's a lot of research and a lot of literature out there on the reward or lack thereof of raising kids .
O,I don't think what we talk a lot about because it's I guess it's scary is the reward of giving someone a good exit .
O,And I recognize I'm doing a lot of virtue signalling here but I was in a position I hate that phrase by the way their virtues in virtue signalling is just an ad hominem attack against people you don't like .
O,Hold that aside all of .
O,So I don't like myself .
O,No no I mean when people accuse you of virtue signalling they're not attacking your idea they're saying oh you're just going to own the little man's imposter syndrome .
O,I think I sound like a better person than I am and I want to acknowledge I want to talk about that also
O,hold me Barry .
O,Anyways I was in a position and a lot of people aren't .
O,But my mom was a light of my life raised me alone on a secretary salary .
O,But it's not a sob story we had a nice life .
O,There's a lot of discipline and a lot of love in my household and I decided I had the resources and I had the flexibility to take some time off and I moved in with her .
O,I asked her what when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer I said What's on your bucket list
O,right .
O,That's what Sunday's right .
O,Instead I only have one thing on my bucket list and nice of what science said I want to die at home .
O,I'm like okay we can make that happen it's not going to be easy but I can figure that out .
O,I moved in with her so I moved into the Del Webb Active Living seniors community in Summerlin Nevada and during the day I would manage my mom's health care and we watch Jeopardy and look at old photos and at night I go downtown to the strip get drunk and party with strippers .
O,It was a very unusual yet very rewarding part of my life and I will cherish that I'm most proud I think of my children my professional or modest craft professional success and also just giving my mom the right exit and I'm blessed because a lot of people can do that .
O,But what I'd say to people is if you're in a if you're in a position to help your parents excite me more dignified and I'm not talking about it's the right thing and you're a good person .
O,It's very rewarding .
O,It was she and I really nothing went unsaid and it was it was a nice . It was a very rewarding opportunity and it's something that I'll cherish the rest of my life .
O,I found that to be really inspirational and something that was was really interesting in the book .
O,Let's talk a little about some other things from the book that I thought was was fascinating
O,while you're young get credentialed and get yourself to a city .
O,Sure .
O,Explain .
O,So we live in a caste system we like to think it's a meritocracy .
O,U.S. is very much an increasingly become a caste system and explain what that caste system is .
O,It's simple it's where you get to college and that is show me two things
O,I can tell you how much someone is going to make within fairly tight band based on two things where they're certified where they're credentialed in terms of the college they went to and their zip code .
O,Show me someone who has an engineering degree from Dartmouth who lives in New York or San Francisco I'm going to show someone who's making 150 k a year by the time the 30 show me someone who's a high school dropout living in Little Rock Little Rock .
O,That person's like if they're making 40 K by the time they're 30 .
O,We live in a caste system get certified and I recognize that college isn't always the right thing for everybody .
O,I don't care if it's a classroom driver's license and a citizen's license or a member a union card .
O,You have to get credentialed
O,also while you're young . Get to a city two thirds of the economic growth is going to happen in the top 20 cities in America over the next 20 to 30 years .
O,It gets harder and harder to be in a city when you get older and start collecting jobs and kids who get there while you're young .
O,But people constantly come up to me and say my son's thinking about dropping out of college maybe as the next Steve Jobs .
O,I assume your kid is not Steve Jobs .
O,And we have these very well publicized examples of college dropouts going on to do well and that is
O,the three of them though you Gainesville Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs how many of .
O,Tell me about the rest of the Fortune 1000 top 100 people in those companies .
O,Any of those dropped out of college .
O,Yeah very few and most have graduate degrees increasingly fewer but almost all of them have college free is
O,now the problem is is the man in the mirror tests academics . We have become drunk on exclusivity .
O,We no longer see ourselves as public servants .
O,We see ourselves as luxury brands and we brag about the fact that 90 percent of the people that apply to NYU don't get in .
O,Which is tantamount to a housing or a homeless shelter bragging that they turned away 90 percent of the people who showed up to sleep there that night .
O,That is not a good thing .
O,You and I both went to remarkable schools that gave us remarkable opportunities and we've talked about this both you and I were remarkably unremarkable
O,and if we hadn't had the generosity of New York and California taxpayers respectively pick us up by the scruff of our neck and fling us forward into opportunity . You would neither you nor I would be here right now .
O,So let's talk about that a sec because it touches on both the credentials and your mom .
O,I love this story from the book
O,you've gotten . You had gotten rejected by UCLA and your mother kicked you in the button says reapply
O,right .
O,I just got rejected three months ago .
O,Doesn't matter reapply opinion .
O,You write to them .
O,I'm a native son of California raised by an immigrant single mother who is a secretary .
O,If you don't let me in . I'm going to be installing shelving for the rest of my life .
O,My parents both dropped out of school or were taken out of school when they were 13 to work for their families in London and Glasgow and they came here and either I could either live at home or go to UCLA or I wasn't going to college .
O,We just don't have the money for that .
O,And people say well the world is your oyster you can do anything in America .
O,No I wasn't .
O,I didn't know I didn't have that confidence we didn't have money .
O,There was just I just I find that the downside of a meritocracy and capitalism is that we assume anybody can be anything and if you're not successful you're a loser you screwed up because we live in a society supposedly where anyone could do anything .
O,And my dad who is well-meaning but not what I'd call you know a very worldly guy said You don't need college I'm guiding I'm getting you a job installing shelving which by the way was going to be 18 bucks an hour which seemed like a lot of money to me and could fulfill my dream of getting a Z 28 or a transition which was the only goal I had at the age of at the age of 18
O,and my mom said you need to appeal to UCLA .
O,You have to go to college .
O,She was smart enough and the truth has a nice ring to it .
O,I literally said I'm letting me into I'm installing shelving and I remember the day they called me at home and this woman said you're a substandard student but you don't test well but you're a native son of California and we're going to let you in .
O,And I rewarded them with a two point two seven GPA from UCLA and then they took another chance on me and let me into grad school at Berkeley .
O,How did you get into Berkeley with mediocre grades .
O,So my my only saving grace is I'm an idiot savant with standardized tests .
O,Yeah .
O,So .
O,Or as my wife would say you're half of that .
O,Yeah I'm just an idiot when it comes to tight .
O,That's the way I'm half that but so I was able to get into grad school how did you get into Berkeley from UCLA with bad grades and bad tests .
O,Again generosity of woman named Fran Hill .
O,I know I had some positive
O,attributes I had finagled my way into Morgan Stanley
O,I had offers from several investment banks I interview well
O,I took a job with Morgan Stanley because I heard they didn't check transcripts and I lied about my grades
O,I heard they didn't drink or they don't check transcripts well they didn't back then and then some years and then a kid found out they found out a kid was accused of insider trading had never graduated from the University Illinois and they started checking your every strand service
O,anyways that was the benefit of an analog age is that you could you sure I was stuff like that and they also I heard they didn't drug tests which ended up being a lie but
O,anyways went to Morgan Stanley I was involved in a lot of activities I was an athlete at UCLA so I had some positive stuff but I remember them calling me and saying we we love your application but we think there's an error
O,it says that your GPA is two point to seven which keep in mind is not easy to do .
O,No that's it because if you get less than 2.0 you go out at academic probation and you go subject to dismissal
O,so you've got to get a bunch of d and then you gotta get above a 2.0 to reset the clock for two more semester .
O,Right .
O,So I came perilously close I was sleepwalking through life like a lot of 22 year olds to not getting into you know getting kicked out of UCLA .
O,But again Berkeley took a chance on me got my act together I think like you I was a bit of a late bloomer and you know started an upward spiral but if it hadn't been for the generosity and vision of California taxpayers and the regents of UC Berkeley we'll graduate more kids from low income households this year than the entire Ivy League combined seven of the tents amazing seven of the 10 universities with the greatest income diversity are all university or university California schools .
O,But in general I would argue that universities in the U.S. have lost the script see themselves as luxury brands .
O,We need to massively increase the number of seats we need to tax endowments if they don't grow their seats faster than inflation Stanford has tripled it has tripled the number of applicants
O,they haven't increased their freshman seats hardly at all
O,that is in my opinion a crime
O,the head of admissions at Harvard says we could have doubled our freshman class without sacrificing any quality 38 billion dollar endowment .
O,Well Boston why aren't you doing that .
O,This is literally become we have to get to a point where we're more like Canada where more kids have access to the greatest the greatest lubricant for upward mobility in the world .
O,And that is higher education .
O,And speaking of lubricants the higher education you've made a number of gifts to both Berkeley and NYU .
O,Tell us what motivated that .
O,Is that just gratitude and giving back .
O,You know I just pant did .
O,That was an easy one for me .
O,I was just an easy one .
O,I got really lucky .
O,And you know I just want that .
O,That was just easy .
O,If it hadn't been for unfortunately college is a lot more expensive now .
O,And that was just an obvious nod to two .
O,Again California taxpayers and the jewel of California the inner city California .
O,So that was just a overdue nod to to the University California .
O,So let's talk about luck cause it's a really I don't know call it a theme but it's a thread that runs through the book and it's worth exploring a little bit .
O,You reference how incredibly lucky you've been .
O,Mm hmm .
O,I've had numerous people sit in the seats that seat where you are .
O,And they've all said billionaires Nobel laureates . Masters in Business who have said you know but for a lucky break here or the way the Beyonce bowl bounce there I wouldn't be here today .
O,Well look it's easy to credit your character in your grip your successes in the markets for your failures .
O,I have no such delusions .
O,And it's not a humble brag .
O,It really is and it can be tiny switches in your DNA or the way you're born my wife .
O,I think I've talked about this with you .
O,My freshman roommate in the fraternity to be born in 1964 a white heterosexual male in the greater United States in the United States the greatest country in the world .
O,And in California which was about to experience the greatest increase in value and yet history there was more value creating a seven mile radius of SFO from 92 to 99 than all of Europe since World War 2 .
O,And I would just happen to be at the right place at the right time luckiest person in the world right .
O,A white guy heterosexual we had advantages that other people did not have and that's unfair .
O,But the reality was I was all of those things .
O,And so I got very lucky .
O,There was one other question I wanted to get to before some of our favorite questions and I have variations of our favorite questions all right .
O,2017 . You mentioned that you were selling assets you were moving to cash .
O,Have you still are you still in that stupid .
O,I was a reaction and I was angry about Trump's election and I got advice from you I was be in the market .
O,We can time the markets and I sought the motorists told me the same thing I went back in the markets and I thank God I did .
O,It's been an unbelievable ride up .
O,I do think there are certain canaries in the coal mine now .
O,I think when modestly talented 25 year olds are getting one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year because they know how they know Python when midtown or downtown real estate and bad you know kind of marginal areas is getting 50 or 60 bucks a square foot you know it just
O,I see mediocre restaurants you can't get reservations at there's a certain I feel like we're late cycle let's say you feel that we're ready we're do .
O,So here's the interesting thing coming out of the financial crisis you tend to have a longer more modest . This is Ryan Reinhart and Rogoff research . You have a longer but more modest economic expansion .
O,So here we are .
O,The session ended technically 2009 2010 .
O,It's nine years later it's a pretty long run .
O,It's the longest ever .
O,I mean this is kind of it's bad news it's pretty close to it .
O,I mean you could you could go through earlier periods and post-war with two periods and find it although there were a lot of small recessions late 50s early 60s .
O,So we're the problem is it's such an artificial period with Fed stimulus et cetera et cetera .
O,It's if it's the longest one it's the longest one with an asterisk
O,although when you look around the world Australia went more than 25 years without a recession in the boom period of China's growth .
O,So that's kind of interesting isn't isn't all this basically our generation has gotten really smart .
O,I'm just on the tail of the baby boom
O,hasn't our generation just perfectly gamed the system and figured out a way to elect officials and basically said we want the greatest transfer in wealth ever occur it ever registered in history to be from every other cohort to baby boomers
O,so basically big tech is a vessel of the transfer of wealth from the entire world to the U.S. and then to the coasts and everything from Social Security to artificially suppressing interest rates to drive ups our asset values to Social Security to mortgage tax deduction to capital gains is nothing but a giant transfer of wealth from every cohort to baby boomers from the future pulled back the .
O,Let's listen .
O,So I would argue trillion in debt .
O,I would argue low unemployment you're technically not a baby boomer you're sort of in the valley between the boomers Gen X and Gen X like to me the baby boomers ended in 1959 .
O,If you were born in the 60s I'm 64 .
O,Your job so my sister was born 64 .
O,I get two and a half years on you .
O,You don't really feel like a baby boomer .
O,That's a whole different you
O,like . I don't relate to the boomers I kind of look at them askance but I also look at Gen X which is totally different thing than me .
O,But I think the boomers are the worst generation and I think history will bear that out .
O,The greatest generation .
O,Yeah absolutely .
O,And everything in my view we talk about there's a horn on I go on Fox once a week because I like to go behind enemy lines and they they came by the way I love watching you on that because they don't know what the hell to do with you you're clearly capitalism means you socialists you they you just sold L2 to Gartner last year you've sold how many companies have gone public or been purchased 3 4 .
O,Yeah I'm 3 4 and 2 .
O,OK .
O,So that's a great track right
O,now really .
O,Yeah .
O,Listen you know that's what's great about America's guys like me can survive .
O,I'd be in some sort of prison if I know
O,if you're a venture capitalist you're going to make 100 investments you're looking for the one home run 3 4 and 2 is a great track record for stop and think about how start startups fail .
O,Yeah well most of my questions is success is really resilient resilience so
O,there's a lot to that .
O,You keep mentioning grin but they don't know how to deal with you because you're you are a capitalist .
O,But you talk about empathy and about helping others and about things beyond mere money and they're perplexed by it .
O,Well it's it's so that they had this it was hilarious they had this socialism versus capitalism week on Fox and guess what . Capitalism won .
O,Go figure .
O,And so they invited me on .
O,And for some reason they also introduced me as a socialist .
O,And I like those guys .
O,So Stuart Varney and Neil Cavuto I think that really Lou great .
O,I know you're really intelligent investing guys and they're generous to me they're nice to me I really like the people over there despite being in sort of a you know them spinning up hate on a regular basis .
O,Right .
O,Other than that hate based business model they're fantastic .
O,But I'm writing and I'm going to need your help on this AMERICAN article for The Economist or I'm claim to be writing an article and they on on capitalism and socialism is nothing but OK the means of production controlled by the state and divvied up by and the spoils divvied up tariffs are socialist of course artificially suppressing interest rates or socially imperative of telling telling an air conditioning company to locate in Michigan is socialist child labor laws are socialist .
O,Capital gains tax cuts .
O,Socialist .
O,So you me and the president walk into a bar two of us are capitalists .
O,The president is a socialist and just about the entire reimbursing farmers who supported him against Chinese tariffs .
O,How is that anything but social .
O,I mean we're really going off script now but you look at the .
O,I initially thought okay I'm a fan of actually going after China for unfair trade I believe that we have this unbelievable eco system where the greatest universities in the world trained some incredible human talent and in concert with incredible financial system we create innovation that's just unparalleled .
O,The Chinese then steal it rent and sell it back to us for 30 cents on the dollar .
O,So I am all for a trade war .
O,But here's the problem one we could have done it with partners and to the Chinese think in 20 or 30 year increments .
O,They're willing to shut down towns and say upstart you need to relocate .
O,The terrorists are bad we don't care .
O,Relocate it is what it is .
O,A farmer goes out of business and MSNBC is out there and the president is trying to bail them out .
O,We just don't have it's like fire .
O,It's like going to war with Russia .
O,You can have better tanks you can have better officers .
O,Their willingness to endure suffering is just going to it's just going to end badly for whoever invades them and I think the same is true of this trade war unfortunately .
O,So normally around now I would go to my favorite questions but you studied them so many times I had to come up with some new ones .
O,Variations I am so so let's let's underground this .
O,All right .
O,So normally around now I ask what you the first car you own but I'm going to ask what's the next car you're going to buy .
O,You know you're a car guy .
O,So I'm I'm in the midst of a midlife crisis that I think I'm gonna grow out of in about 30 or 40 years
O,right .
O,So I am by the car it's cheaper .
O,I got .
O,Okay .
O,That's right .
O,So I have a GM 550 I have a truck right now more than that .
O,Oh it's a make believe I have .
O,That's an amazing car .
O,I love like an old guy .
O,Is it our thing .
O,I roll up bits of baby I look so German and so interesting in that car .
O,Well we know on TV most like cars .
O,Yeah I mean cars .
O,So I mean yes they you know they just redesigned it .
O,And when you look at it you can't unless they're side by side you can even tell a fantastic change .
O,I have the model X the Tesla .
O,I don't like electric .
O,I like I just don't like the feel of it .
O,I like an internal combustion engine .
O,It's a great car .
O,I don't enjoy it I don't like it .
O,By the way go on YouTube .
O,Watch the videos of the model exploding Ferraris and Lamborghini .
O,No it's .
O,It is a superior car .
O,But Elon Musk called a cave diver trying to save young people's lives a pedophile and I went on CNBC the next day and I announced I was selling it .
O,So I have to sell the thing right .
O,And by the way the depreciation on those bad words is significant .
O,Enormous .
O,So I said Okay I gotta get another car and you merely weighed in and said and I'm thinking I want to get a range rover because I'm all about signaling my worth as a manager and as a mate .
O,So I need to find some ridiculously overpriced
O,you have the g wagon so I would picture you in the HSC l 550 not the G Wagon .
O,Oh I think you stupid car .
O,That's what I thought you were talking about rides twinkly theology .
O,Also you have the little rubber Joe lumbar support you .
O,I immediately assumed you went G Wagon on on on that .
O,I'm not sick I'm insecure but I'm not pathetic .
O,That's that's what I'm always back against I miss that .
O,That's right .
O,That's literally like .
O,Okay .
O,I'd say German military if I need to find a way to spend more money than owning a hummer .
O,Right .
O,That's right .
O,I own a get the AMG version of it .
O,It's like two hundred and twenty thousand totally ridiculous .
O,So so the GM writes you I'm asking you a question you know me pretty well
O,yeah .
O,What's my next car .
O,Pick it pick it .
O,So what's my name .
O,So you're you're a dual city .
O,Yeah right .
O,Yeah you did floor to me .
O,I don't see how you don't have a 9/11 convertible to hell .
O,Dude I can't fit in a porch .
O,I'm serious there and I have buddies with 6 6 who do modelling .
O,I am not a players guy probably I am not a problem but I do not fit into sports I have an elbow out each window .
O,OK .
O,How does a ridiculous car .
O,It's a beautiful car .
O,I don't think it's beautiful it's just a very fast and good handling car .
O,That's not a .
O,You want a pretty car go buy a Bentley goodbye .
O,I'm not a smart guy .
O,All right .
O,So then what is what is the big dog role and .
O,Come on .
O,So I have an M6 convertible that's m 6 .
O,Now me just explain his .
O,Dick you let me just explain Zoe .
O,I'm also a cheap S.O. B so I won't go out and spend a hundred that's called not having kids .
O,You don't have kids I have kids I have .
O,I have a house I have 5 cars and a boat but all that aside I bought this car off of lease from Indianapolis right .
O,A pristine condition .
O,Yeah and I paid labor the guy that used to surf to the recycler when you're a teenager .
O,No I said no .
O,Well look at cause Sure .
O,All right .
O,Now you back to me whack Hardaway by Sarah .
O,Sell a car master's in business .
O,What car do I get .
O,See I Frustrated professor angry range rover HSC boy . Is that so I should do is now understand Range Rovers are wildly overpriced totally right .
O,They lease out terribly they purchase terribly .
O,They're not known for their mill for their mechanical roller Range Rover HSC .
O,But if you want to signal that you're single I'm in the US .
O,I mean that's the way to go .
O,Yeah .
O,Even though I can give you a million reasons why no one should buy that car .
O,But the signaling to show your worthiness to take care of Sarah you get me .
O,I you really do .
O,Even though you should be in some cute little sports car .
O,I'll see you in a family or anything .
O,So in the book I discovered a fascinating thing about one of your mentors .
O,Your mentor taught the exact same class in marketing and branding that you teach
O,my cat classes based on David Walker's course father modern branding
O,didn't know what I wanted to do as we referenced before business school is mostly for the elite and the aim was that people who want out of the profession are an idea .
O,I didn't know what I wanted to do .
O,I just knew I didn't wanna go back to investment banking took the second year class of David Walker .
O,He talked about the importance of yellow and how intangibles created more shareholder value than any other any other system or contract in history .
O,He really kind of identified and encapsulated the brand era and I thought this is what I want to do with my life .
O,And I went to him and said I'm starting a consulting firm based on your principles called profit .
O,I'd like you to join you said no way I'm not interested in working with you your second year student but long story short in profit ultimately was sold was
O,Yeah we get to 400 people it's still around today .
O,I think it's about 500 people now sold it down so tremendously rewarding and ultimately David did join as vice chairman .
O,But you know what do you want when you go to school you want to find someone who inspires you and sets you off on a career that is rewarding personally and economically and I got that from David Walker .
O,So around now I asked the book question .
O,Tell me about your favorite books .
O,But we've done that a read on that .
O,Yes I'm to ask you a different book .
O,Yeah .
O,Different book question .
O,Tell me about a book that changed the direction of your life .
O,It's weird .
O,He just died actually
O,I read my first kind of real novel was in high school and it's not that dramatic I read a book by Hermann Wood called the winds of war
O,sure .
O,And just learning about big thick book in book and just learning about World War 2 and you know what it was probably the kind of the defining conflict of our century and what different groups around the learning about the Holocaust it just sort of got me thinking about things I had never thought about and sort of changed got me interested in history . I mentioned war history so that for me was sort of my kind of first adult book if you will .
O,So you are an open book and you reveal yourself warts and all .
O,I'm an open book very .
O,But tell us something we don't know about Scott Galloway .
O,Is there anything we don't know that's pretty much lay it all out there .
O,I was the Bruin bear mascot my sophomore year at UCLA .
O,I know that when I won most comical in junior high school in junior high school junior high school Paul .
O,Most comical
O,I don't know they voted for that guy right .
O,And Steve Martin that's I'm aging myself .
O,I got Steve Wait wait wait .
O,And since then I haven't had a single award .
O,Wait .
O,Steve Martin you know they do .
O,Do you remember in high school in junior high they would do you know and just to give you with the age and die score I got Steve Martin .
O,That was my thing in the high school . Paul
O,Oh so most likely to be like Steve you are not a nut .
O,I went to school with Steve Martin .
O,No no .
O,Who I think is a decade or so older .
O,For sure .
O,So tell us what you do for fun outside of class outside of school usually holding on to a fiberglass chair
O,pretty pretty boring .
O,Not that interesting you know time and kids a lot of Netflix you are watching on Netflix .
O,My new favorite show is I mean I'm like everyone else I'm obsessed with Game of Thrones I think Veep is the best rated show on TV even you play the new show that I love is fleabag which may or may not have heard .
O,Who's the person who wrote fleabag wrote something else .
O,Oh really .
O,I'm trying to remember what it was .
O,I haven't started fleabag it's outstanding and also killing Eve is really wonderful .
O,Really .
O,Yeah .
O,So every Thursday night I do the same thing I commute between her and Florida .
O,I go home .
O,I take Iran I come back I put my kids to bed I vape with my wife I'm finally competent enough to say that .
O,Mm hmm .
O,And then we watch television .
O,So I think the key I think the defining art form of this age is television .
O,You know we are in the Golden Age of Television
O,hundred percent .
O,I'm going to give you three recommendation .
O,Go for it .
O,One of them I don't know if you're going to like you like sci fi at all .
O,Lay it on me Barry
O,The Expanse
O,The Expanse
O,macular .
O,Where's that .
O,So the expanse there's TV I don't know about it's either networks or Amazon .
O,So the expanse takes place in the not too distant future .
O,You have three political powers you have earth .
O,Yeah you have Mars and then you have the the belts out where the miners are out pulling stuff off .
O,Anyway fashioning science fiction really kind of interest you watch the terror .
O,I don't know if you are .
O,I watch Ridley Scott there and I love Ridley Scott the terror and one of the last yeah phantom Black Mirror and Electric Dreams is another .
O,Okay so all right .
O,But the two hands I want to share with you .
O,Have you started seeing on Netflix . I'm sorry
O,I haven't as I grace its self picture .
O,If I had to sum it up in 30 seconds .
O,Female comedy writer married with a little girl
O,picture a female version of Curb Your Enthusiasm .
O,Not as nasty but more of a sitcom funny .
O,Yeah very very good .
O,And the new one I just started the new one I just started watching with Christina Applegate dead to me .
O,That's good .
O,Really really is so along those lines watch Ricky Jr. versus new series already went through .
O,Fantastic .
O,That's life .
O,Something like that if that life for whatever really strong .
O,All right .
O,Our last two question yes .
O,And the problem I can't ask you the advice you'd give . You have a millennial because your whole book is advice to millennials .
O,What advice do you wish you got when you got out of college that nobody told you
O,it's going to everything's gonna be OK .
O,I was insecure I admit in the book there they're they've survey seniors on what piece of advice they would give themselves to their younger selves and consistently it comes back and it's sort of the same advice
O,they wish their one wish and their advice themselves is they wish they'd been less hard on themselves .
O,Go easy on yourself and that is look at lifespan you're going to screw up and bring forgiveness .
O,I mean one of the keys to long term relationships is forgiveness .
O,It's difficult to maintain a long term relationship unless you assume the other person is gonna occasionally screw up and you need to bring forgiveness to the relationship and you also need to bring that to yourself and be a little late because in the moment it seems like a big deal .
O,But if again the one piece of advice seniors would give themselves they wish they hadn't been so hard on themselves .
O,So it's gonna be you know it's going to be OK
O,quite fascinating .
O,Scott Galloway this has been absolutely delightful .
O,And you saw the range rover and I saw the red write in HSC .
O,Be sure to get with the upgraded package that stops and does the Lena Vaughn's warning and I'm not a fan of that car but that's got your name written all over it .
