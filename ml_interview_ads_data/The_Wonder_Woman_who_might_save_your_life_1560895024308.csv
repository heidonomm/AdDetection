B-AD,If you're listening to this podcast it means you're ready .
I-AD,No more than ready to have a major breakthrough in your business .
I-AD,You're hungry for change and you're hungry for growth .
I-AD,But do you know where to start .
I-AD,Or if you've already started but are feeling stuck .
I-AD,You need some help someone to talk to about your business plan and how you can accelerate growth .
I-AD,That's why Tony Robbins is offering a free one to one business strategy session from one of his top business coaches
I-AD,a six hundred dollar value completely free no strings attached .
I-AD,That's right .
E-AD,If you're listening right now you can go to Tony Robbins dot com slash CEO to sign up for your free session and get started on your own path to massive success .
O,Today over 35 million people subscribe to Sirius XM Radio .
O,But it was only 30 years ago that the very concept of delivering high quality radio service to listeners via satellites was almost inconceivable .
O,And yet it did happen .
O,In the early 90s the FCC established frequencies and licensing rules for the first ever satellite digital audio radio service .
O,And it was all due to the persistence of one woman Martine Rothbart .
O,The company that she started from nothing is now a six billion dollar business and with its recent acquisition of Pandora is set to capture even more market share in the fast growing digital audio space .
O,Even if this the founding of serious was all she had done it would still be quite an accomplishment .
O,A level of success that most people only dream of achieving .
O,But Martine didn't stop there .
O,She pivoted her entire career as an engineer and shifted her attention to biotechnology creating United Therapeutics in 1996 after finding out her daughter had pulmonary hypertension a rare life threatening disease .
O,Today United Therapeutics sells five FDA approved pills for pulmonary hypertension and has experimented with pig cloning and genetic modification to create organ transplants . The body doesn't reject .
O,When Martine found out that 80 percent of donated lungs end up unusable . She figured out a technique to manufacture them in unlimited quantities and overcome the severe shortage of donor organs .
O,She even went on to invent the first electric helicopter to deliver them in a way that's environmentally friendly .
O,Martine was the top earning CEO in the biopharmaceutical industry in 2018 earning a compensation package of more than 37 million dollars .
O,But she's not just a pioneer in business .
O,She underwent gender reassignment surgery decades ago and has been a powerful advocate for transgender rights ever since .
O,Earlier this year a Business Mastery Toni had the privilege of speaking with Martine and he was completely blown away by their conversation .
O,Listen closely because in this episode Martine shares how she has built her entire career on achieving the seemingly impossible .
O,And she also reveals her own process for turning visionary ideas into technology that we can use every day .
O,Thanks for taking the time .
O,I know how crazy busy you are all of you are .
O,So let's take the time to help these entrepreneurs here is really really beautiful .
O,Do you know where to start with you .
O,You're the Renaissance woman I mean it's amazing what you've done .
O,Tell us if you would . You went to UCLA .
O,I read that your engineers some UCLA members out there .
O,You studied engineering of laws I understand you got an MBA .
O,You did all the above .
O,I mean somehow you came up with this idea of using these satellites .
O,You tell us the genesis of that and how you made that shift .
O,Sure Tony .
O,I love space and satellite technology .
O,I grew up seeing the space shuttle being launched .
O,My father was completely awesome that we could leave the planet and begin to spread humanity through the solar system and ultimately beyond .
O,I grew up reading science fiction by Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Heinlein and I just felt that the Earth is a tiny part of this beautiful galaxy and it's the purpose of us humans to spread our civilization our beauty our happiness throughout the cosmos .
O,So I thought like well what can I was that for a mission .
O,How .
O,Yeah .
O,So I thought like well what can I practically do right now with that .
O,And I knew that there were rockets that one could buy and you could put satellites on the rocket and I knew satellites could do lots of cool things could track vehicles driving around could take photographs of crops and estimate weather conditions .
O,So I began to think well why couldn't we use satellites to broadcast radio so that people driving long distances wouldn't have to keep tuning to a different channel of the radio and that you could in fact have instead of just 10 or 20 channels in the city you could have hundreds of channels and every niche of radio every genre could be appreciated .
O,So I did all the calculations I put what age did this happen with you do you get the sense .
O,This was my 30s in the 30s and I put together all these calculations .
O,I submitted them to the Federal Communications Commission and ultimately they approved it .
O,I went to Wall Street .
O,I raised the money to launch the system and it's been one of the greatest joys of my life to be able to meet the hundreds and hundreds of people from all walks of life all corners of the country who have said that Sirius XM helps them get through each and every day of their lives .
O,They told me you give her but it's amazing .
O,How some of the stages in that growth you come up with that is a large idea to say the least and you go you sell the idea .
O,But how did you get your initial funding .
O,And were there some tough times in the beginning or were you able to just really take off with the right personalities and so forth .
O,You know Tony what really kept me going was the the science and the technology .
O,I did the math and I knew that the system would work .
O,But instead when you try to change something radical like this it seems like everybody tells you no it won't work
O,right .
O,But I mean a million people can tell you that two plus two is not four but you're not going to believe them .
O,You know two plus two is four .
O,So I did the what work are called in engineering the linked budgets the calculations to show it would work .
O,And when people would say no it's going to get blocked by trees it's going to get blocked by wires .
O,It's too far .
O,You can't have an antenna on a car pointed to the satellite .
O,I said Well let me do a demonstration for you .
O,So I built a antenna on top of the USA Today and that building across from Washington D.C. It's the tallest building in the Washington D.C. area .
O,And I made the power of that antenna equal to whether a satellite with broadcast and then I clipped a car with a flat antenna that was right inside the roof of the car .
O,I brought all the FCC people into the car and I drove around .
O,I drove through Rock Creek Park if any of you know Washington D.C. It's full of trees and the signal worked perfectly .
O,So then they couldn't say it wouldn't work .
O,Then I went to Wall Street and they said OK it works but nobody is going to listen to this .
O,Why should somebody pay for radio when you could get it for free .
O,I said well you pay for TV .
O,And they said well that's different .
O,I said No it's not .
O,But I found some investors willing to take a bet on this especially when I came up with a new model I said instead of people always being interrupted by commercials they could just pay a monthly subscription fee and get 100 different channels with no commercials .
O,People saying to me that on the very first day we launched the satellite there would be nobody to subscribe to it .
O,So I had to raise enough money to carry us through a few years .
O,But there were tough times and we were running a cash flow negative .
O,How much did you raise in the beginning of a man's job
O,over two billion dollars .
O,Wow .
O,And I will I'll tell you publicly and I've said this before and it's it's beautiful because our Howard Stern has said to me Martine you gave me my life this is my dream .
O,You've made all of this possible .
O,And I've said back to me I said no Howard you saved the butt of Sirius XM because never do we get more subscribers and more loyal people willing to pay for Sirius XM than after Howard came onboard .
O,Wow that's amazing .
O,And what made you believe Howard would be such a pull at that stage you were a New Yorker .
O,He was already very popular Howard was network in 10 different cities through Infinity Radio .
O,But there were rules out the government level that you could not own more than 10 radio stations .
O,So when I went to the FCC and I said I want to bring content like classical music like Howard Stern like deep track vinyl and whatnot I want to bring this to every single city in America .
O,Then what happened is the National Association of Broadcasters said that's illegal .
O,Why should you be able to own a radio station in fact 100 radio stations in every town and city and village and nook and cranny of America .
O,And we ABC Radio and CBS Radio We can only own 10 .
O,That's not fair .
O,And I said you know technology changes and you have to why should people living in smaller towns be deprived of the content that people get in New York City and Washington D.C. .
O,Fortunately the FCC agreed with me .
O,And even though people said what I was doing was unconstitutional and was going to you know destroy democracy in America all that book you know fell away .
O,And what I said to the FCC is truth and technology will always triumph over both and bureaucracy .
O,Awesome .
O,That's .
O,Weird . Where does this certainty come in so I can see I can understand the engineering side because you knew it was the fact you've figured it out .
O,But this belief that I can go raise billions of dollars this belief that I can change the rules completely .
O,Where does it come from in your life were you born with that .
O,Was there a stage in your life where you started to vote out certain you start more trust than yourself .
O,Where does it come from .
O,Yeah you know trust is a it's a something of a becoming and I don't think it's realistic to think you come from a position of no trust to complete trust in yourself .
O,And I look at I always say one of the adages that my company is that people who criticize you and challenge you are your best friends because those are the ones that are pushing you to think through things that you haven't thought through .
O,So when I started with satellite communications and designing the Sirius satellite it was in fact too big to fit into a rocket .
O,So the people that told me this was impossible were not entirely incorrect to make a satellite so powerful that you could blast a hundred channels into a flat antenna .
O,There were no rockets at the time large enough to carry that .
O,So I looked around the world I talked to the French company Aryan spots and they were just in the process of developing a much larger rocket .
O,So I said Well this is a perfect use for that larger rocket .
O,And they said yeah that that is and one thing leads to another Tony .
O,It's the same thing with a current company I have United Therapeutics .
O,When I said I have a medicine that can stop the disease that's ravaging my daughter's life .
O,People say you don't know anything about medicine you're a satellite engineer if if if it existed . Doctors and Scientists for they've invented it .
O,I wasn't sure but I kept doing the research and the more I learned the more certain I got .
O,So I think confidence is something that you have to build up bit by bit .
O,Yes .
O,Let's .
O,I want to go back to Syria .
O,But you've opened the door .
O,Talk about your daughter Genesis .
O,Tell us a little about what happened with her and how did you go from an engineer to biotech and build another billion dollar company .
O,Yeah .
O,So I'm I'm running serious and Ari we're skiing in Colorado and our youngest daughter suddenly her lips turned all blue .
O,She has no energy .
O,We went home .
O,We went to doctor after doctor .
O,Nobody can say what was wrong .
O,Finally she couldn't walk up the steps to the house and we end up at Children's National Medical Center the biggest children's hospital but the head of cardiology and she has said this . They said that she has a one out of every million person disease and she's going to die and three to five years .
O,So I just said like you know no that can't happen .
O,And they said I said there must be companies working on a cure .
O,No this is too rare of a disease .
O,No one's going to make a cure .
O,There must be some other medicine that could be repurposed to this .
O,No this is a disease that only affects the blood vessels between the heart and the lung and there's no way to just effect those little set of blood vessels and not affect all the other blood vessels in your body
O,so Tony I had no confidence I could do I could do anything in this area .
O,But you had to
O,have to save my daughter .
O,Yeah I had to save my daughter no matter what .
O,I want to just punch my fist through you know the strongest concrete wall to save her .
O,So I just sat there and said as I said before I kept learning and learning and talking to doctors and whenever they said something couldn't be done I figured one way around that .
O,And one of my favorite sayings is like it takes ninety nine no's to get a yes .
O,So people can tell me no ninety nine times and I appreciate every additional one of those notes because that's gonna get me closer to my yes .
O,And finally I was able to find in the in the library at this hospital an obscure publication of a drug that was being developed for a completely different disease .
O,But they know this to reduce the blood pressure just between the heart and the lungs .
O,And they said this is of no use to heart failure .
O,But I said wow that's exactly what I need .
O,So I made a beeline to that company Glaxo SmithKline .
O,I said to them I will pay you guys to develop this drug because by that time serious had gone public I had resources they said no we don't need your money we're a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company .
O,We're very sorry about your daughter but we don't develop drugs for orphan indications .
O,I said OK sell it to me I'll do it .
O,That wouldn't be ethical you're a satellite engineer you don't know anything about medicine .
O,We might be sued .
O,So I had to keep you know knocking on their door when they told me I didn't know anything about medicine .
O,I hired some medical doctors when they told me they would only license it to me .
O,I got lawyers to come up with the licensing .
O,Long story short I got that medicine out of there by the way when I got it hasn't come up that way .
O,Well I will tell you why I ran I ran because I felt like I was Jack and the beanstalk and I had just gotten the gold medal .
O,And I was running out of there before they changed their mind .
O,How long did this process take from the time you heard about Genesis real problems to the time you were able to find the solution .
O,18 months 87 incredible .
O,That's unbelievable .
O,Talk about a mother's love lifting up a Volkswagen private industry .
O,Tell us what's come out about what's happened to your daughter .
O,Important most important of all is that Genesis is alive and well and
O,she was supposed to live how long and how old does have been since then .
O,So it's been a journey United Therapeutics was formed in 2000 so we're not coming close to like 20 years .
O,She's been a hero throughout this whole effort after she finished college .
O,We just imagine Tony everybody through your whole life since you're a little kid is telling you you know you're going to die .
O,You have a deadly disease a fatal disease .
O,Bob Bob Bob
O,she surmounted all of that and then says what I want to do with my life is I want to work in this company Martine that you started to save my life and help everybody else with this in the case .
O,Wow .
O,Beautiful beautiful .
O,So she she inspires me each and every day here today to support me .
O,So what has happened is that our medicines it turns out by the way that when genesis was diagnosed there were two thousand people in the whole U.S. with this disease because almost everybody died within five years .
O,So people are constantly born with it and then they died .
O,So it only got to be 2000 people was the prevalence
O,today thanks to hard medicines the United States are over 40000 people live now .
O,Awesome .
O,I'll get it .
O,Ladies and gentlemen .
O,So I think what is happening is that as we've been successful it's like this Nelson Mandela quote It's okay to shine .
O,It's okay to be full of pride in what you've accomplished because when you do that you inspire everybody else to come in and do the best of themselves .
O,That's why I love you so much Tony and I love everything about the way that Tony Robbins activity because you let all of us shine and be the best people that we can do that automatically your stuff is beautiful .
O,Thank you .
O,So people began calling emailing writing .
O,I have an aunt and uncle a cousin a brother or sister with a rare disease .
O,And I was scared because you know I didn't even really know what I was doing with Genesis .
O,I was just going one step at a time and I still had never taken a biology course since high school .
O,So it was it was scary .
O,But bit by bit we began working on more and more rare diseases and I perhaps the most astonishing one was five years ago when we developed a drug that cures half of all the instances not 100 percent but at least half of our terrible childhood our rare cancer called neuroblastoma .
O,Yes .
O,So before we got this approved by the FDA five years ago and before we got it approved it's a horrible disease and a horrible death .
O,And 100 percent of the kids with this would die including like a brother of one of our board of directors many other people
O,today . Half the people with this disease that take our medicine five years after they've taken it they have no disease at all .
O,It never goes and comes back .
O,They go on and they live their whole lives happily ever after .
O,Incredible .
O,So the company is taking on other rare diseases now as well .
O,Tell us about the company .
O,Was it grown too .
O,Yeah .
O,It's grown quite a bit .
O,Tony we've had this this drug which by the way I would have thought that after I did serious everybody would say OK Martin you know you know how to run a business will invest you know whatever you need for United Therapeutics .
O,It turns out that beginning all the investment had to come from me because Wall Street said well nobody is going to buy this medicine .
O,I mean there's two thousand people if they pay you know like a thousand dollars a year that's that's not going to cover all of your costs .
O,So that that medicine and that drug that people thought would be absolutely useless today generates a billion and a half dollars a year .
O,And how much did you capitalize the business originally .
O,So myself and was capitalized originally at the level of 20 million dollars .
O,Wow .
O,And that's 20 million dollars has now grown to a market cap of 5 billion .
O,Wow can say 40000 live 40000 people today .
O,That's incredible .
O,Incredible .
O,So one of the one of the rare diseases that I've become I think a little bit obsessed with and very very passionate on everybody loves when you become obsessed . Because it means life's going to change is a people who need an organ transplant a kidney transplant a liver transplant a lung transplant or a heart transplant .
O,And for people with my daughter's disease and some of the other ones that we treat if there's no medicine that can help them . Their only solution is a transplant .
O,And I've met some of my daughter's young friends who before our medicine got approved their disease advanced very rapidly .
O,There's one delightful young lady Kristen Gill day .
O,She could play Mozart beautifully on the piano .
O,She got a lung transplant .
O,Her body rejected it .
O,She lived her last year of life in a hospital and died and I vowed to myself that I was going to stop that sort of thing from happening .
O,So I have been on a mission for the past few years to say why can't we manufacture replacement organs the way we manufacture replacement parts for cars and machines and planes and so our company has become a leader in this area of organ manufacturing .
O,I always start practically .
O,So I said Why don't we start with the organ said people nicely donate but are throwing away because the transplant doctors think that they're you know being out of the body too long been without blood too long .
O,So it wasn't founded the number was like 80 percent of lung 80 percent where 80 percent are just throwing away the lungs .
O,Somebody is nice enough to have donated that .
O,Unfortunately they got in a motorcycle accident or something and they died and the doctors and I don't really fault the doctors because they've got at the other end at person who is on there literally last leg .
O,And if the lung is damaged or beat up a little bit they say well I don't want to put this in somebody who's on their last leg in the intensive care ward .
O,So my myself my team we invented the technology that creates an artificial body .
O,It's under a dome and in this artificial body under a dome we can take a dead lung and not all the time but about 60 percent of the time we can restore that deadline to being just as good as a brand new living lung .
O,We've now gone ahead and transplanted those into 1600 people have walked out of the hospital with brand new lungs . Or otherwise been thrown away .
O,I just I just you know I think all of us were so lucky to be alive in this time of day when somebody can have this dream like I say you know truth and technology well like pounce into the ground both bureaucracy and it was a lot of both bureaucracy that led those lungs to be thrown away too .
O,Now we're saving them we're moving that technology out to hearts kidneys .
O,Our next frontier is thanks to the breakthroughs that have been done by Craig Venter and people like that in the human genome .
O,I said why can't we learn the pig genome as good as the human genome .
O,Because it turns out that the pigs organs are the same size and shape as human organs .
O,Some of you may have known that people needed a valve replacement for their heart and they got it from a pig .
O,Now what they got was not the actual pig's valve because what's happens is all the tissues in the cells are stripped off that valve but the shape of the valve is the same shape as the human valve .
O,So it works as a replacement for it .
O,So I said why can't we go ahead and decode the pig genome learn the pig genome as well as we know the human genome and then modify those parts of the pig genome that give rise to rejection when the organ is put in to the United States .
O,Americans need a hundred million pigs a year .
O,I'm one pig for every three people in America every year .
O,I said why if we could just go ahead and take like a million of those pigs a year we could cure every single person in America with heart disease lucked out having the latest word Oregon .
O,Exactly .
O,Everybody would have an organ on demand .
O,So that's my goal .
O,That's United Therapeutics goal as I am confident that we will accomplish it this decade .
O,You're extraordinary .
O,I have sort of deep respect and love for you .
O,Thank you .
O,No there's nobody like you on the planet but it doesn't end there .
O,You .
O,She also cares about pigs .
O,I'll tell them what your next level is that you're not working on under the X Prize you're working on .
O,So it's it's really not so much about the caring about the pigs .
O,Is that everything in biology is complicated and it's it's some rare machines and we're beautiful machines and it's why I said at the beginning that you know my ultimate vision is for people to spread into you know the moon Mars other space habitats .
O,It's amazing what evolution has ended up giving us .
O,But when you go ahead and you put something like a pig organ into a human being we can chisel off enough genes so it won't be rejected out of hand but no matter how many genes that we chisel off it's still going to be rejected in the same way that another human donated organ .
O,So you'll have to use immunosuppressants
O,now . That's OK .
O,I mean it's better to be alive and taking immunosuppressants than not being alive at all .
O,But it would be much better if you could get a replacement organ and not have to take immunosuppressants at all .
O,So I saw a clear technology pathway to do this which starts with using the technology of what's called induce a bull pluripotent stem cells .
O,We live in such an awesome time you guy amazing that just within the past 20 years we have discovered that you could take a cell from your body and you can turn it back in time to becoming a stem cell and then you can roll it back forward specifically to be a cardiac cell or an alveolar cell for the lung types of cells for different types of bodies .
O,So the idea is that we could 3D print the scaffold or the shape of an organ and then stream over this scaffold or this shape to induce a ball pluripotent stem cells the the cells of the person who's gonna end up receiving the organ .
O,Now some people need an organ like immediately they are in a car accident .
O,They're part of our armed forces fighting some players .
O,And for those people the Xeno organs the organs from the pigs they'll be great because I'll always be rolling off the assembly line they're always be available .
O,Most people who have end stage organ disease it's coming
O,they see it coming .
O,They've got a year two years three years to go
O,for . So for those individuals my commitment is during the twenty twenties we'll be able to say to them Look the bad news you got end stage renal disease and stage liver disease whatever it is that's the bad news .
O,The good news is that we have time to first of all take a cat stand to get the exact shape of your particular organ .
O,We'll take a biopsy skin sample .
O,We will expand we will turn your skin cells back into stem cells and then we will read differentiate them back into the particular type of organ that that individual needs .
O,We'll expand them .
O,We'll secularize the scaffold that we printed with your cells and within about six months time we will have for you an organ out of the bioreactor that matches your DNA .
O,It can replace your bad organ and you will not have to take any immunosuppressants or any other drugs for the rest of your life .
O,I know Dr. Peter out here at Wake Forest has been doing that with ears or ears and he also has bladders bladders .
O,How will the how is this different than what you do because he's not be able to progressed to that point yet .
O,What do you what's the angle you're looking at that's different out of curiosity .
O,So with the ears and the bladders you have more of a model they are type of situation .
O,And with the organ you've got a three dimensional dynamic machine so you need to have first a scaffold that operates in a bioreactor .
O,And we've been able to practice at our at our R.A. headquarters in Research Triangle Park North Carolina .
O,We are very fortunate to get the best and the brightest of those schools .
O,Wake Forest as you mentioned and many others .
O,So what we do there day in day out Tony is we decelerate some of those pig organs that we could have and then we reseller I said with human cells we have learned how to do it so well that we now produce 500 of those recent authorised organs every year right there and
O,what type of organs are you doing now .
O,We're doing lunch there .
O,So you're doing the ones you're actually growing the wings .
O,I mean we are growing the lungs and we are doing them in three dimensions way beyond where 20 Ayatollah hands .
O,What are you doing .
O,He's doing great work .
O,Oh he's doing fantastic work but he hasn't been able to do with organs for the complexity that we but we do .
O,We put those organs into backbones of which the FDA requires you to use as an animal model before you go ahead and put them into people .
O,We now have our hearts lasting years actually three years in a baboon kidneys over a year and about Boone .
O,So where are you in phase two or phase 1 trials where you
O,feel more of the backbone . It counts as preclinical or
O,preclinical That's right .
O,When I take a bath in phase three by that .
O,But how long after you set free .
O,It's preclinical .
O,So in the 20 20s we will be in the clinic with people walking out of the hospitals with those new organs .
O,Wow .
O,Because we have about that's incredible now is if there's not enough room look at this woman's consciousness right .
O,Her consciousness that is we're talking in the Vatican she's saying but I'm really troubled because we need to get these organs to people and you know to do that . You're flying helicopters around or jets around and it's polluting the moment I'm thinking I'm a good person because I'm planting five million trees every year to cover my carbon footprint .
O,She doesn't do that she wants to invent a new way to deliver these things we have to what you're doing with helicopters and also what you're doing with air taxis in China if you would .
O,Yeah .
O,So it's you know a major use of helicopters and planes is transplanting is transporting the organ transplants for example the last week we had four lung transplants that required eight Lear jets you know to move them all around within a 24 hour period .
O,So this business uses a lot of flying off of things around .
O,I am a ridiculous I probably am a number one fan of Tesla .
O,I have like 10 Teslas and a popsicle every single one from Roadster is all the way up through access .
O,And so you know as I'm a geek and then my here's how I'm playing with my car .
O,I'm and I'm a helicopter pilot and I I'm saying to myself you know I see the kilowatt power output of my bell 429 helicopter .
O,I see the power output of my Tesla Roadster model S .
O,This power should be able to fly this machine
O,again . A lot of people said no to me in fact Bell people said it couldn't be done .
O,I went to other helicopter companies they said it couldn't be done .
O,So that's the worst thing to say to Martine .
O,So I've put together a tiger team and almost everything we do in United Therapeutics is Tiger Teams
O,my absolute favorite quote is from Margaret Mead who says it only takes a small group of committed individuals to change the world .
O,Indeed nothing else ever does .
O,And that's what I see all of this all of the tribes and all of the groups .
O,These are small groups of committed individuals entrepreneurs or my tribe .
O,And so we put together this team .
O,And Tony in less than 12 months with less than 2 million dollars of funding we created the world's first electric helicopter giving up .
O,Ladies and gentlemen .
O,Guts .
O,I don't want to brag .
O,No .
O,Please .
O,I'm channeling my inner Nelson Mandela here .
O,Okay good .
O,Last month I got the Guinness Book of World Records for the world's longest flight in an electric helicopter .
O,We are now building a thousand electric helicopters and you will see these manufactured organs from United Therapeutics being delivered to hospitals by electric helicopters that will be able to subject to FAA approval .
O,We'll be able to be flown autonomously until we get the FAA approval .
O,They'll have a pilot flying them .
O,Wow .
O,But Tom I know I know full well that these helicopters can fly autonomously and land autonomously .
O,So we'll get the FAA approval for that .
O,And you're just going to see like a highway in the sky of Wings of Life you know helicopters flying manufactured organs saving people's lives coming back to the nest in North Carolina picking up more manufactured organs and flying on the hospitals .
O,This is no sci fi dream .
O,This is no you know wishy washy .
O,I mean it's not who I am .
O,I'm like you know if you can't come together .
O,If you can't make it or build it I'm not that interested in it .
O,And so these are things that are people real solid people are making and building right now .
O,Well you also are the largest aren't your largest shareholder meeting in China .
O,That's correct told people about bankruptcy you know it already exists .
O,That part exists right .
O,Yeah .
O,So hang on why she is a good friend of mine he's the CEO we hang .
O,Amazing story .
O,This guy he demonstrated is he hanging at the Consumer Electronics Show .
O,I showed it eye contact .
O,I saw it .
O,I contacted him I said let's meet that L.A. Expo .
O,We met over at the FBO at L.A. X. And he told me a story how he was the guy responsible for building the air traffic control system for the Beijing elect Olympics .
O,He's actually just a super computer geek .
O,And when the Beijing Olympics occurred they needed to upgrade their air traffic control system .
O,He did all that .
O,He learned how to fly a helicopter .
O,His best friend became his instructor and forcing the instructor crashed his helicopter and died .
O,And why she vowed that he was going to make a helicopter that would not crash .
O,That would have like multiple layers of failsafe guidance so it would like land itself .
O,It would sense and avoid obstacles around .
O,And he was wanted to make them all electric because he too saw no matter how much good we do in saving people's lives and bringing health to people if the whole planet is sick because of overheating and over polluting the whole planet then everybody is going to go down .
O,So I found myself to have a true kindred brother in why she and became the largest shareholder in e hang and
O,how far can they go and how many people could be how much weight can me all these days .
O,I know it's small versus I've gotten bigger .
O,Yeah .
O,It has gotten bigger .
O,So the original one was a one idea e Hank one eighty six and that could go about ten miles and hold two people .
O,Now they have a 2 1 6 8 2 1 6 that can go 50 miles and hold two people plus a hundred pounds of additional cargo .
O,And the project did he and I are working on together is the E hang with called the 4 1 6 that will hold two organ tenders and three organs and we'll fly autonomously for up to one hundred and fifty miles .
O,Is .
O,Your common denominator seems to be you make a decision to solve a big problem .
O,You had a phrase you used .
O,I remember when we were together at the Vatican I think you said something like the world's biggest problems are the biggest opportunities .
O,Tell us how you look at problems and tell us the process because it sounds like you just are totally self education .
O,You go full tilt it doesn't matter what anybody tells you .
O,You know the outcome you know there's an answer and you keep digging do you find it .
O,Tell us a little bit more about the process what you because you've done it over and over again here .
O,So I think the main common denominator Tony is really one of practicality .
O,I try to make an assessment as to whether or not a problem is practically solvable .
O,So first of all that I think that starts with physics and I'm a huge supporter of stem education the number one charity that I support is Dean in Caymans first robotics many first robotics folks here .
O,OK .
O,Thank you .
O,So I love first robotics because I'm a third of the participants are girls and women .
O,And that's something that you don't see in a lot of other STEM activities and it teaches everybody science technology and every year you have to actually build a robot and you have to actually do something with it .
O,So I started off with science and technology .
O,Is this problem within the laws of physics .
O,Then I take a look over at engineering
O,engineering is the application of math and physics to a material science that exists today .
O,And for example when I was growing up I really had a huge dream and a huge desire to build large habitats and space
O,physics math . It could be done .
O,I learned that from this guy Jared K. O'Neil physics professor at physics at Princeton .
O,Unfortunately the engineering was not there we didn't have the engineering capability .
O,So Dr. O'Neil invented a G.P.S. type of system and I became the CEO of his company and that got me into all of this satellite communication stuff .
O,So satellites for practical and with regard to the organ manufacturing I would love to be able to push a magic longevity button and slow down the rate of our cellular death as we were talking you know to stop I don't know how to do that now .
O,I don't think it violates any laws of physics I've read that great people like god like Feynman and these famous engineers as physicists say there's no physical reason why people can't live indefinitely but engineering wise we don't know how to do that right now is
O,replacing organs .
O,Yeah we know how to do that we're transplanting people right and left like get an old car you make it new but replacing the engine we've got 50 2s being flown by the grandchildren of the engineers that you know worked on on building the original be 50 52 just by replacing this parts .
O,So that's something that can be done .
O,So I ask myself is that practical from an engineering standpoint .
O,Then the third thing I do is I just chop it up into little pieces of that are . Each step is less than a year to get there
O,because I think as humans we've kind of from evolution we've evolved ourselves that we can work on things that have more than a day to day concern we can build a house we can take a trip to some number of weeks or months away to find a better place to live or better food .
O,But if you say to a human we're going to work on something for 20 years .
O,It's it's hard for us to do that .
O,We're not really wired that way .
O,So I take these practical projects and I I divide them into one year some projects and at the end of each year there has to be something awesome like we have to save a life .
O,We have to fly a helicopter .
O,We have to get a Guinness Book of World Record .
O,And and then I carefully stack these one year projects and at the end of ten years of these projects we have something that seems miraculous like satellite radio like a medicine to save 40000 people's lives like a manufacturing organ .
O,So you took it down you make it six flights .
O,So on the manufacturing of organs .
O,What's your one Euro twits .
O,Well the major ones right now for the next year
O,so that we have five different another .
O,Another secret sauce I would say is to be very careful when you're developing technology not to put all of your eggs in one basket .
O,Yes and the more challenging the technology the more careful you have to be about hedging your bets .
O,So I've got several different teams working under a model of what we call co-op petition
O,got several different teams each competing with each other to manufacture organs . Also co-op trading on the same deal and going about it different pathways .
O,So from one year from now we plan to ask FDA approval to transplant the first manufactured kidney into a person .
O,Wow .
O,So that would be basically the end of this year .
O,Wow .
O,And then the FDA will mull that over .
O,Yes .
O,Hopefully the government will be in business .
O,Yes .
O,If they're not we'll do it anyway .
O,Just say that .
O,But hopefully they'll be in business and 2020 is a reasonable timeframe to say that the first clinical manufactured organ would occur .
O,That's exciting .
O,Well it's over and again .
O,That's incredible .
O,It's really incredible .
O,There's also the part of you that just I hear how you've done this .
O,But I heard a step first that correct me if I'm wrong .
O,We've talked to her about the tyranny of how so many people try to figure out how they don't have the certainty that they're going to do it with your daughter for sure .
O,You just frickin decided .
O,Mean you went and found out .
O,You assumed it sounds like maybe I'm wrong that the physics can certainly support healing a body right .
O,You may not have the engineering yet .
O,How much better is just deciding this is so important having strong enough reasons that then you find the answers to those questions .
O,You know the beautiful thing about the human mind is it's like a quantum computer .
O,It can take in so much information and then just collapse into a solution .
O,Yes
O,right away .
O,And you look at the situation and you be open minded and you say well if something was wrong just between the heart and the lungs that's something that must be fixable .
O,Yes .
O,So what's the solution .
O,If if the energy output of my bell for twenty nine is a thousand kilowatt hours and the energy output of my Tesla Roadster is 1000 kilowatt hours I should be able to make the helicopter fly electric plane .
O,And if if a billion bodies can manufacture organs day in day out since time immemorial not to mention all the animals in the animal kingdom now why can't we do it too .
O,I've always said you know if you want new answers you ask new questions or you ask those questions would you ask them with certainty that they don't need to be answered .
O,Talk to you about your personal life .
O,It's okay because one of things I wanted to do here is represent men and women .
O,And you've had an experience where you were born a man and you had a different experience of what's inside .
O,You mean the translation and you're such a role model .
O,I wonder if you share with us .
O,When did you notice there was something different in how you navigate to what's your life like today .
O,There is a human mind like I said it's like a quantum computer and it's the thing about quantum stuff it's kind of spooky like reality's pop in and out of existence you never know what's going on .
O,So I had constantly in my mind that even though society had labeled me and categorize me as a boy and then a man I felt that in fact I was just as much if not more a girl and a woman .
O,Yes
O,but I was as any social being I'm supersensitive to not wanting to be laughed at not wanting to be bullied not wanting to lose all my friends .
O,So I just kept all of that bottled up
O,what stage of life did you realize that
O,this was it from teenage years on we're teenagers okay .
O,Yeah .
O,So I just kept all of that . You know just bottled up in me
O,and when I'm in a meeting or in a group and a club going out to a bar to a restaurant to a party and you know there's a bunch of guys hanging out like around the keg and whatnot and then there is you know some women over here I just found myself saying why am I here around the keg when you know I really want to be hanging out with the women .
O,But I was embarrassed and ashamed to do that because I knew that I would be humiliated if if I did that .
O,So I just kept it all bottled up in me and went all the way through the launch of serious completely presenting as a man
O,the only person who really knew any different was my best friend my soulmate wife spice whatever you want to call it . Bina
O,yes .
O,And shortly after we got married because I was I was scared .
O,I loved her so much .
O,I love her so much .
O,That I was scared .
O,We've been married like 35 years so we're best friends and every day I love her more than the day before .
O,It's beautiful .
O,So one night we're dead and I said look if you never want to hear this again I'll never say it again but I have to tell you that inside myself I feel like I'm a woman .
O,And when I'm making love to you I feel like I am a woman making love to a woman and she's just like the most awesome person I've ever met .
O,And she's like OK you know I can understand that .
O,I didn't really fall in love with a male or a female or you know a big person or small person .
O,I fell in love with your soul . MARTIN And you've got a beautiful soul and that's all that matters .
O,You redefine everything doing
O,so with her support and we have four children and I ask each one of them I said look if you guys don't want me to do this transition to female I won't .
O,We must have raised somewhat right because everyone the four of them said no it's fine with us from Genesis up to her oldest brother Eli .
O,So I did transition in the middle the satellite communications industry .
O,It was their words . There were some jaws dropped and whatnot but interestingly because you know we're all entrepreneurs here the response of Wall Street was was surprisingly I guess predictable .
O,I remember like this one guy at a large fund .
O,It was his Colorado based based fund the name will come to me in a second .
O,He said Me Martine it's had fun with the faith Jarvis fund channel's fund out of out of color .
O,Sure
O,he said Martin . I don't really care if you show up and work in a gorilla suit as long as you keep making money .
O,Grabbing him on Wall Street it's a meritocracy right .
O,So I still don't have any gorilla suits .
O,So it's been I . It's been no problem being a public company CEO openly transgender and I again I feel there's so much that I give gratitude for the love of my partner the love my family the .
O,But probably really close to the top of the list Tony is just being able to be alive in 2019 at this point in time when people can be themselves yes in a meritocratic sense not everywhere not all the time not everybody but certainly this is the best time in the history of the earth to be alive with that
O,as digital transcendence and how you look at that it's a term that most people term probably not even familiar with maybe you can define it for them and give a little sense of that and then also I know the language of you know kind of cyber consciousness and where how you look at the world and how you look at what is happening to consciousness and how it will spread around the universe .
O,Sure well a lot of people have become interested in the possibility of digitally mapping our minds outside of our body .
O,A lot of this started with Alan Turing in the 1940s and the 1950s .
O,It's it's actually a kind of interesting Segway from what you brought up about transgender and as many of you may know Alan Turing is pretty much I would say the father of cyber consciousness as he laid out how a computer could be conscious .
O,He the Turing say some of you heard about right .
O,It's hard to know whether this digital intelligence could be perceived as human .
O,And he was also the guy that cracked the German encryption so the role war too and played a significant role in allowing the allies to world . World War 2 .
O,What's a little bit less known is that he was a gay man and he was a horribly persecuted by that in the UK and finally driven to suicide after being arrested outed humiliated and forced on to medical therapy that he didn't want .
O,And we have to think like what would happen if somebody like Alan Turing had been given the freedom that somebody like myself of has had
O,I would say cyber consciousness would already be happening because he was onto it .
O,But now it's almost like you know Google is taller than it with the mind and Yvonne Musk with our mind uploading .
O,So it's it's no secret that our brains are full of neural connections in each of these neural connections are settings that give rise to all of our memory .
O,The software inside our mind is astonishing because it allows us to recognise each other and to form beautiful sentences and create amazing projects like all of the companies and the projects that you guys are doing within this group .
O,So the software is astonishing .
O,And the question is one will we ever be smart enough to take that software that's within our mind and create a version of it outside of our mind and you can believe that's possible or not .
O,I personally believe it's possible
O,that the body goes away and you put a different substrate to hold your consciousness .
O,Yep .
O,So I think that that's an engineering problem .
O,There's another point of view that says that the brain is so complicated that we could never replicate it outside of our body .
O,My response to that is that a a modern chap like a 777 Dreamliner has something like three million parts .
O,A bird has something like 30 billion parts but the jetliner flies really really well it doesn't do everything the bird does .
O,But we don't need our jetliners to be eating worms and you know so I think like a cyber consciousness might be a little bit different but it's just like if you grow up in America you're gonna be a little bit different than if you grew up as a pygmy in the middle of Africa .
O,I mean your environment is going to change you so I think that's doable .
O,Finally I believe that we our bodies are so beautiful and magical that even after we are able to upload our minds into a competing site substrate and have a Tony Robbins working you know online not just in his body that we will still want our bodies too because I can't even a man I don't even have the imagination to imagine what it would be what could be better than a human body .
O,So I think we will end up happening is that we will use this regenerative medicine technology that you've heard me talking about if I'm making hearts and kidneys and lungs and livers which we are making and many other people in our industry are making to truly will be making skin and hair and pulling the whole thing together .
O,So I definitely don't believe that cyber consciousness means bodies are going away .
O,Bodies are here forever .
O,But what it does mean is that we'll be able to accomplish much more than we can accomplish when all of our mind is instantiated just in our body .
O,We'll be able to accomplish everything that's instantiated in our body as well as having our mind working outside of our body doing lots of other things as well .
O,The bottom line is that life is going to get much more better more interesting more fascinating and I believe it's going to bring us ultimately to the realm of available what I call techno immortality that we will be able to live as our personality as our consciousness as long as we want .
O,Because even when one given body runs out you won't run out you'll still be living outside of your body and you will be able to contract for a replacement body to be built and your mind downloaded back into it .
O,I'm doing a minor version of this right now .
O,I'm building an A.I. as we speak and I have every intervention I've done since I was 20 years old recorded .
O,So you know massive machine learning and I also am disciplined so I've to every interaction since I was twenty three . I dictate what I did what worked what didn't why . We have all the principles
O,we already have the audio or the video at the highest level but that machine learning it work can look at you and read you even better than I cannot remember every single thing I'm doing that so that I could help millions of individual people and millions of places simultaneously .
O,I'm also building one for business and I'm also building with my grandkids and my kids so that I can continue but the idea that I could not just have created that consciousness and have it grow and maybe teach me while I'm still alive could continue but that I could somehow be a part of that consciousness long term is just mind boggling .
O,And seeing someone like you who has taken everything that couldn't be done and say can be done I wouldn't bet against you in a million years and I'm on your team is pretty extraordinary .
O,But thank you .
