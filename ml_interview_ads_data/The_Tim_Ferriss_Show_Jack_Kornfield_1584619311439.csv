O,"Hello , boys and girls , ladies and germs , this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Fair show where it is My Job Every episode to deconstruct world class performers , people who are excellent , if not the best at what they do in many , many , many different fields ."
O,And that scratchiness is Tim Ferriss coming off of antibiotics because I had some little gremlins inside me that I brought back from the Amazon .
O,That's a separate story .
O,"In any case , my job doesn't matter that it ended up deconstruct that event ."
O,"Many fields and this particular episode we have a wonderful guest , Jack Cornfield ."
O,"Alice Walker calls Jack , quote , one of the greatest spiritual teachers of our time ."
O,"And quote , Jack trained as a Buddhist monk in the monsters of Thailand , India and Burma , shortly thereafter becoming one of the key teachers to introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to the West ."
O,He is taught meditation internationally since 1974 .
O,That's before I was even a glimmer in my papa's eyes .
O,"So it's been teaching for a very , very long time ."
O,And he has had a profound and direct impact directly on my life .
O,"So I'm thrilled to finally have him on the podcast to share our shared history , his incredible stories and the practical tactics and very detailed techniques that you can use ."
O,And we dig into all of that and you can also say hi to him on the Internet at Jack Cornfield on Twitter .
O,Check it out .
O,Jack's history just a little bit won't spend too much time on it .
O,"Jack co-founded the Insight Meditation Society in Bar , Massachusetts , with fellow meditation teachers ."
O,"Sharon Salzberg , who's also been on this podcast , and Joseph Goldstein ."
O,"And later , the Spirit Rock Center in Wood Acre , California , which is where I did my first silent retreat ."
O,And we talk about that .
O,"He holds a p_h_d_ in clinical psychology , which is important to me and comes into this conversation because he's a very , very diverse toolkit for dealing with many different types of personal challenges , issues , questions and so on ."
O,"And as a father , husband and activist , his books have been translated into 20 languages and sold more than a million copies ."
O,He is prolific .
O,"His books include and I pulled some of you for your favorites , A Wise Heart ."
O,"That's number one , a lamp in the darkness ."
O,"A Path with heart after the Ecstasy , the laundry ."
O,"One of my favorite book titles of all time and his most recent book , No Time , like the present subtitle , Finding Freedom , Love and Joy Right Where You Are ."
O,He is quite possibly the most purely compassionate human being I've ever interacted with .
O,And compassion isn't a word that I use very much .
O,But Jack is unique and I'm thrilled to give you a window into his story and his teachings .
O,"Without further ado , please enjoy this wide-ranging conversation with Jack Corfield ."
O,"Jack , welcome to the show ."
O,"Oh , thank you , Tim ."
O,Pleasure to reconnect .
O,"I have wanted to have you on the show for some time now , and you've had certainly a tremendous impact on my life , both through writing and through firsthand in-person interaction , which I think we'll touch upon ."
O,"But first , I wanted to ask you a complete non-sequitur from that , which is something that our mutual friend Adam Ghazali suggested I ask you about ."
O,"And Adam , for people who don't know him , is an incredible peach DMD neuroscientist based at UCSF ."
O,And he suggested that I ask you about hang gliding .
O,And I have no idea why he suggested that .
O,But I'm going to start there .
O,"And if it doesn't go anywhere , we can , we can change direction ."
O,But I figured we would just start with that and then we're going to rewind the clock .
O,But why did he suggest I ask you about hang gliding ?
O,"Well , it started many years ago when I cross-country with a friend who had a hang glider and we would stop periodically and go off different hills ."
O,And it was fantastic .
O,And then I wanted to do paragliding and started to learn it .
O,"Now , because everything is developed and paragliding is like , you know , is a lot more official ."
O,"You need a license , which I don't have ."
O,"But one of my favorite things is to tandem paragliding , go off the top of places like Grindle walled in in Switzerland , where you can take the ski lift up to 9000 feet and then jump off and float silently like you're a bird among the clouds ."
O,"The birds actually do come by sometimes and like , check out what's this big bird flying up here ?"
O,You can catch thermals and go way up above the glaciers .
O,And it's one of the most thrilling and delicious experiences that I know .
O,That's incredible .
O,See you .
O,You first experience that at what age ?
O,"And probably in my , you know , late 20s and did some and then sort of put it aside ."
O,"And then I was travelling and teaching in Europe and I saw a sign for paragliding and I said , oh , gosh , I really want to do it ."
O,And started .
O,"And now each time I go where there's high mountains and paragliding , that's one of my things that I love doing ."
O,"You know , there's something about it ."
O,"I've had most we'll have these dreams once in a while , if you're lucky ."
O,"A dream of flying or maybe in your meditation , you have this sense of not being limited to your body ."
O,And and this is the closest thing that I know because it's absolutely silent and you're floating there .
O,It's quite fantastic .
O,And this is something you still do and and hope to do it and hope to do it next summer when I'm back in the Alps .
O,And how old are you now ?
O,"72 , 72 ."
O,"GOODMAN Well , we're going to then go back a bit in chronology and ask about childhood ."
O,I would love to hear you describe your childhood .
O,What were you like as a child ?
O,What was your upbringing like ?
O,"Well , first thing to say is I remember when I got to Dartmouth College in 1963 and I called my mom from the payphone in the dorm sometime in that fall ."
O,"I didn't call very often , but you know how it is ."
O,"And I said , Mom , I said , guess what ?"
O,There are a lot of other really fucked up aside .
O,So that's kind of where we where we where we start .
O,"So there yeah , I had three , three brothers and my father was a mixture of a tyrant and an really abusive person and a brilliant guy ."
O,I was born on and on a Marine base in .
O,Toward the end of World War Two .
O,"And they didn't send him overseas to do they put him in the medical part of the Marines because he tested so high on their tests that they know , okay , we're gonna use him for something ."
O,So he was brilliant in certain ways .
O,"He was a biophysicist who helped design some of the first artificial heart and lungs , worked on the space program , but also did other kinds of weird stuff like work for the army , biological weapons , people not making biological weapons ."
O,"We're trying to design things that were kind of computer biological interfaces , all kinds of creative stuff ."
O,But he was .
O,He was .
O,"He had mental problems , and so we didn't know when the car pulled in whether we were going to get Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde , he would come in and , you know , either he could shout , be abusive , throw my mother down the stairs , rant , chase after us , tried to hit us , whatever , or we'd get this interesting creative person ."
O,But we hardly ever had people come over when he was around during the daytime where we would because you never knew what you would get .
O,And so our family life and my family life in some way was also there were great parts of it because I had my brothers and we were like our own gang .
O,"We moved all the time , but we had each other ."
O,"And because he was wacky as well as smart , my father either quit or got fired every year or two and then we would go from one place to another ."
O,I went to .
O,"I don't know , eight schools by the time I finished high school ."
O,"So my childhood , partly it was there were the happy things of roughhousing and being a boy with with three other boys and adventures and then in the basement ."
O,My father had all kinds of scientific equipment .
O,"He had all this stuff from World War to this huge radio from a battleship that you could tune into a thousand different , you know , shortwave stations around the world and projects ."
O,He was trying to design stuff .
O,And so we learned from them .
O,You could pretty much take our design or do anything in the physical world .
O,"And at the same time , I felt like my whole childhood was also sure how to say it colored with the fear of his violence and his unpredictability ."
O,So I became kind of a peacemaker in the family .
O,We all sort of had our roles .
O,And now I do it as a profession .
O,Right .
O,Trying to kind of make it a little smoother between my parents so that they would kill each other .
O,And each of my brothers had their own strategy .
O,"My twin brother , who is a lot bigger and much more outgoing ."
O,"We played football , which I certainly didn't ."
O,I was skinnier .
O,"And , you know , I was in the orchestra and he was that football player ."
O,"But anyway , I remember when he first got in a fist fight , we'd like to add because my father was abusing her mom and my twin brother had been , as young men sometimes do , probably 13 , 14 , any pretty big ."
O,"And it was looking in the mirror , you know , making muscles in the mirror to see how strong he'd become ."
O,"Anyway , he just , you know , got into a fist fight with my father ."
O,And I was both thrilled and terrified .
O,And but it worked in some way because of the abuse .
O,Settle down quite a lot after that .
O,So that was his .
O,His strategy was just to get angry .
O,"And then later , kind of to go his own way somewhat more , although we're also all been very close as brothers ."
O,"So there was that at the same time , there was a lot of interest ."
O,Intellectual interests .
O,So we read and learned about all kinds of things .
O,Both my parents were really interested in the world around us .
O,"And so was sort of this mixed thing of the , you know , the gift of being together with my brothers and a mom who is basically pretty nurturing , although she kept trying to leave him and never got it together ."
O,I think it was too scary in the 50s to have four boys .
O,"You know , no job until we were in the middle of this ."
O,"And the kind of healing that it took , it took a long time to do that in inner healing work from the pain of my family ."
O,"And I remember when I became a Buddhist monk and I was sitting these first years with my teacher , Agent Cha , in the forest monasteries of Thailand on the border of Thailand and Laos ."
O,And I've been sitting quietly .
O,"And then some of these memories or energy would come , or I remember one monk who had a pot near mine in the forest did something that annoyed me ."
O,And I just got enraged inside .
O,"And and I sat and then I went to the teacher and I said , you know , I'm really getting hungry here ."
O,And he smiled .
O,"He said , Yeah , where you think that comes from or something like that ."
O,"And I said , Well , I don't know ."
O,"I said , I thought it was a peaceful guy ."
O,It was never going to be like my father .
O,I won't be .
O,"Peaceful , but it turned out it just stuffed all that stuff ."
O,"And so when I told my teacher about it , he said , good should go back in your heart ."
O,It's the hot season .
O,You got a little tin roof and close the doors and windows and put all your robes on .
O,"And if you're going to be angry , do it right in the middle of that ."
O,"You know , and sit in the middle of the fire and don't be so afraid of it because you're afraid of it ."
O,You're just going to keep stuffing it .
O,"And on the other hand , or if you're afraid of it , it will just explode ."
O,There's another way to be with it .
O,"And so that was the beginning of some healing , just to realize that I could actually tolerate the suffering and the energy that was in my still carried from trauma in my body and heart ."
O,"So we're going to absolutely come back to Örjan Chava , because I have many questions on that chapter in your life ."
O,But just just so that I can create the proper visual in my own head .
O,"So you sat there in your hut in the sweltering heat with all of your robes on reading , or were you angry in silence ?"
O,Were you yelling ?
O,"Well , what I was I was pretty much angry in silence ."
O,And that's an interesting question .
O,Yeah .
O,"You know , in the monastery , the culture was not was not much that you would yell ."
O,You go somewhere out in the forest and yell .
O,But it was it wasn't decorous or something .
O,People .
O,"What the hell's wrong with that , monk ?"
O,"So mostly I was sitting in silence and then scenes would come and I would realize , wow , you know , I thought I was peaceful ."
O,I carry every in every cell of my body .
O,"I also carry both the pain and anger , my childhood and my father and just the the anger that comes with being a human being and human incarnation ."
O,And I was never going to have that .
O,"But of course , there it was ."
O,"And it lasted you know , this was I had days of and actually much longer weeks or months of waves of this coming and learning how to , you know , be present for it and not get overwhelmed by it ."
O,So I want to backtrack and then connect those dots between childhood and ending up in Thailand .
O,You mentioned Dartmouth earlier .
O,"And from what I've read , at least you were initially pre-med and then ended up Asian studies ."
O,Could you describe .
O,That experience in Dartmouth or how you went from pre-med to Asian studies ?
O,"Well , you know , we all get turned in these mysterious ways in our life ."
O,We think we're going one direction and then something happens unexpectedly and a gateway opens .
O,So I was coming from an organic chemistry class to the class that I'd signed up for .
O,"Out of interest on Asian studies , raisin philosophy or something ."
O,And it was an old professor and Dr. winx it chan who'd come up from Harvard .
O,He was kind of emeritus there .
O,"And he even sat cross legged sometimes , you know , on the front of the room and would talk about loud too ."
O,And that was him .
O,And they talk about Buddhist teachings and how the Buddha taught suffering and its causes and its end .
O,And that really all of a sudden I sat up and there's an end to suffering .
O,There's a way to do it .
O,"And he said , oh , there's all these teachings and practices where you can transform your heart and mind ."
O,"And I became thrilled about it and realized that whatever impulse I had to go to medical school , I'm probably part of it came from wanting to heal myself ."
O,And so I started to take more and more courses .
O,"And then it was it was the 60s and I became a card-carrying hippie card carrying LSD , taking hippie ."
O,As a matter of fact .
O,And at the end of it in .
O,Yeah .
O,"When I was kid getting ready to graduate , there was still the draft ."
O,"And I thought , well , I definitely know want to go over and kill people in a war that I that I've been protesting a protesting against ."
O,So I decided to go into the Peace Corps instead and ask them to send me to a Buddhist country where maybe I could find it .
O,One of those old Zen masters that you read about and got assigned to Thailand .
O,"And when I got there , people you could kind of request where you went ."
O,And they .
O,"And I said , send me to the most remote place you can ."
O,"I wanted adventure , but I also wanted to kind of reading all those old Zen stories ."
O,I wanted to see if that that still existed .
O,"So , you know , and there were little detours like being in Haight Ashbury in the summer of love and things like that , that definitely changed my life ."
O,"Also in a very deep way , because for at least for a time , there was a window when people were just giving things away ."
O,There was such a sense that the world could be transformed .
O,"Some of it , as we know , very , very naive ."
O,"But on the other hand , it also felt like a greater sense of brotherhood and sisterhood than I had ever known , except with my own brothers , who I love a lot ."
O,And we've done a lot of things together .
O,And I started to feel like there are other ways for me and for the world to be and live .
O,And that was that was also very wonderful .
O,You mentioned you mentioned the three letter acronym that we're not gonna spend too too much time on .
O,"But I I'd you and I , you know , have had quite a number of conversations where I've wanted to ask you about some of your experiences with psychedelics , including LSD , but we've never really gotten into it ."
O,So I figure why not do it in front of a few million people ?
O,"The the LSD at that point , your experiences with that , did that inform your decisions at all to then go into the Peace Corps and end up in a remote area ?"
O,It did .
O,"And I've written a little bit about it in a couple of different of my books chapters in in the books I've written , because the most Buddhist teachers and Indu teachers of my generation also started psychedelics , you know , myself and almost all my colleagues , you know , in the spiritual industry that I'm in , that was a beginning ."
O,"And for me , it showed a credible possibility that all is created out of consciousness and the possibilities of inner freedom ."
O,"And or basically I was able at the best of it , to see my body and my personality and my history and realize that that's not who I am , to become much more the conscious witness of it all to see ."
O,Yes .
O,"Birth and death and to go through those kind of death , rebirth experiences that can happen at times in a deep session with LSD or death of ego or a sense of self , or removing and realizing , wow , there's a freedom and an a life force ."
O,That's what we're made of .
O,And that profoundly influenced my interest in spirituality and also interest in what the world can be .
O,"Now , just a few days ago , I was on Maui with my beloved wife , Trudy , and we were visiting spending time with Ramadoss , who , for listeners that don't know , was the author of this bestseller in the 60s called Be Here Now and Now ."
O,He's 86 and in a Wheelchair .
O,"Ramos , who had been at Harvard University and was one of the early explorers of LSD before he went to India and became a spiritual teacher ."
O,I'm in the living room while we were there two days ago .
O,"Roland Fisher , who is one of the senior professors in psychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University Medical School ."
O,"Rolling Rolling Grillo and Roland GRIFFITHS , rather , Roland excuse me , Roland GRIFFITHS ."
O,And Ron laid out all the research that's happening now on suicide and that he's been doing .
O,"And it's success for people , terminal cancer patients all losing a great deal of their fears that they had working with people with severe depression ."
O,"And it was a beautiful session because you could hear how these sacred substances and these mind altering substances , when they're used in the right context , can really transform human beings ."
O,"And NYU , Johns Hopkins , there's a whole series of studies that are happening now that are finally bringing it back into the mainstream ."
O,So I'd love to underscore just a few things that you mentioned .
O,"Number one , Ramdas for those people who want to do additional reading , formerly known as Richard Alpert ."
O,If I'm getting that right .
O,"He also has a fascinating story coming full circle with psychedelic research beginning , I guess , at Harvard in some respects ."
O,So it makes sense to me why Roland's research would be so meaningful to him .
O,And a number of other just just quick comments for people .
O,"Number one is , if you're interested in in looking into these souls , Simon , which is considered the active psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere , I've actually been involved with crowdfunding in funding myself some of the research related to treatment resistant depression at Johns Hopkins with Roland GRIFFITHS as the senior investigator ."
O,And I'll be posting some updates to that .
O,"But fascinating work looking at everything from and this is also , as you mentioned , NYU and at other very well-regarded universities , alcohol addiction , nicotine slash , tobacco addiction , as you mentioned , end of life anxiety in cancer patients ."
O,"The implications are are are really profound and the data very , very promising ."
O,"And I wanted to also mention to folks who are perhaps saying to themselves , well , I'm not interested in taking some psychedelics myself , that there are people I know , good friends of mine , who do not currently use psychedelics , but had the ego dissolving experience of a non ordinary reality through psychedelics that then led them to become or contributed to them becoming very , very diligent meditators ."
O,"And Sam Harris , who's a p_h_d_ in neuroscience and thought of or very well known as an atheist or you know , one of the four horsemen of the atheist apocalypse , along with Richard Dawkins and others , is a very close friend and extremely diligent meditator ."
O,And he's .
O,"He's written about how his psychedelic experiences , which were in some respects very some of them uncontrolled ."
O,"And you really have a coin flip there in terms of which direction you can go , but showed him possibilities within his own mind ."
O,"That then led to a very , very I'm not going to call it devout , although I should just a bother diligent practice ."
O,So I do want to take us too far off the rails .
O,But you go to Southeast Asia .
O,"Well , I went away ."
O,"We just want to say when we're here , where we move on because we are talking about this ."
O,"It turns out for those who are listening , that set and setting an intention are extremely important ."
O,"If one uses these , you know , psychedelics like psilocybin or something , just set the intention to learn to open , to have a quiet ."
O,It's not not as a party experience absolutely .
O,"Makes you know , it brings your attention inward ."
O,And then all those kind of discoveries have become right in front of your right in front of you .
O,"But the other thing is that whether it's right for somebody to use psychedelics or to use meditation , these are all invitations to step back and see the ."
O,"The story of your life , because we tend to live in the , you know , daily minutia and checking off our list of tasks that we have to do and completing them by work or , you know , or eating or all the kind of things that make up a day and we go on automatic and whether it's meditation and difference or other spiritual disciplines or for some people ."
O,"It also can just be that they have what in Greek is called a cot , a boss , a blow ."
O,"You know , somebody close to them gets cancer or or is dying or they have some accident or something ."
O,"And all of a sudden you step back and you realize , well , life is on certain the way I've been taking it ."
O,It's not just checking off the list .
O,This is a mystery human incarnation .
O,And what am I going to do with it ?
O,"And wow , look at this ."
O,How did I get in this body ?
O,"Look at plants and trees and and language , the air coming out of your mouth that you shape with different ways and it vibrates a little drum in the ear of someone else ."
O,And I can say Golden Gate Bridge and they can envision it .
O,And you start to realize that all of it is a lie made of consciousness .
O,And then the whole sense of who you are and what matters begins to shift .
O,"And you start to realize that life is not just getting through the hoops , but it actually also can be a celebration of the heart of something that you have to bring to the world that you come out of life ."
O,"And my friend Belladonna , a who's a West African shaman and medicine man , also to p_h_d_ kind of remarkable guy , he says , with the dagger up people in West Africa that he's from that ."
O,"They say that every child comes into the world with a certain cargo is their metaphore , like the cargo ships that ply the rivers of West Africa and that that they're given gifts to bring into the world and that we have gifts to bring to this mystery which include opening to it ."
O,"And as we do , love grows , connection grows , and in a whole different way of being in the world happens that we need so much at this time ."
O,So that's a little interlude there before we move onto the net .
O,Your next question .
O,I welcome as many interludes as you would like to interject .
O,"And I wanted to just ask you to say one more time that it was , I believe , Greek word for Cottonmouth , which means a blow ."
O,It's like something comes and it just sets your life spinning an entirely different direction .
O,Like a catalyzing event and .
O,Exactly .
O,"I've had a few those recently that I'd like to selfishly ask you about later , but so I can bookmark just so I can bookmark this name ."
O,"So Stanislav Groth , if I'm saying that ."
O,Yeah .
O,That's correct .
O,When just when did you meet him ?
O,Roughly .
O,What age or what date ?
O,"Just so I can come back to it , because this is another thing I've been meaning to ask you about for a long time and get into ."
O,But I haven't had the chance .
O,So I had there's two things to to say when I came back from the monastery .
O,"And now it's you know , I guess the year that I connect with Stan was maybe 1973 ."
O,I made two really important connections .
O,I came back and start a psychology and graduate school .
O,I was in Boston .
O,And first really important connection happened when I went to a meeting of the Massachusetts Psychological Association .
O,And there was this guy who looked like he didn't look just like the straight psychologist .
O,And it turned out he'd just come back from India not long before named Dan Goldman .
O,Who is it who is a graduate student at Harvard ?
O,"And he had projected on the screen this Tibetan wheel of birth and death that you see in the Tibetan tanker's , that that normally would be taken as some kind of primitive icon , iconic , you know , symbol ."
O,"And he said , no , this is a psychological diagram ."
O,The Buddha was actually more than anything else .
O,He was a scientist of the mind and as a profound psychologist .
O,And here is how graving turns into contentment .
O,And here is how aggression can be transformed into powerful energy to heal yourself and others .
O,"And he was going through this diagram and I went and I talked to him and he said , oh , you you come back from monastery , you've got to come over ."
O,"And so he took me to David MacLellan , who had been the chairman of the Social Science and Psychology Department at Harvard at that time , the one who hired Tim Leary and rammed us ."
O,And then later had to fire them for their LSD work .
O,"And his house , he and his wife Mary were Quakers ."
O,His home was a kind of soiree a where Ramos and Tibetan lamas like jobI and Trump .
O,And I think Krishnamurthy and various spiritual figures would come .
O,People were going to India and coming back .
O,And I connected with this whole group of folks who have now been friends for 45 years .
O,"Richard Davidson was another that I met there , who is now one of the preeminent neuroscientists in the world on studying contemplative neuroscience and affective emotional neuroscience ."
O,It was a whole collective of people .
O,"And Dan Goleman , who wrote emotional intelligence that sold 10 million copies and many others ."
O,And then I got a job working for an excellent growth center in Boston at that time because I was excited at all .
O,The new Gestapo bio energetics .
O,What are the things that are transformative here ?
O,And they asked me to help set up programs .
O,"And I thought , well , who do I want ?"
O,Who do I want to meet ?
O,"So I set up a program with John Lilly and I set up a program with Stan Groff , who is still at Johns Hopkins and married at that time , just married to Joan Halifax , Joan Groff ."
O,And we became friends .
O,And so we have Stan and I have now worked together for 45 years .
O,"I went out to join him at Asselin for many , many years , spending many months together , helping during his development of the whole Tropic Breath work ."
O,That's a powerful breath transformation .
O,And he has been a partner in a hard trend for exploration .
O,"And we've traveled and we've taught in Russia and in , you know , places in Europe and various places around the world ."
O,So this is this is definitely a path that we're gonna come down and dig further into .
O,"But I I'm going to steer us to Arjun Shore , because I want to know , how do you land with the Peace Corps in a more remote ?"
O,"Well , what most people would consider remote corner of the world and end up finding a living master ."
O,How does that how does that actually happen ?
O,I don't know .
O,I but I assume he didn't speak Thai at the time .
O,"I did , actually , was the Peace Corps ."
O,All right .
O,And then I had to learn Lao .
O,"I did , because the Peace Corps at that time , it was very early in Peace Corps had really good language training ."
O,They borrowed it from the Monterrey Language Institute .
O,"So , you know , initially I didn't speak that well , but because I'd also studied Chinese at Dartmouth and he came more easily ."
O,"And I was there working in these in the Health Rural Health Department on tropical medicine teams , mostly malaria , but also typhoid and teams going out to different villages and taking drawing blood and giving out medicine and things like that ."
O,And then somebody said there's a there's a western monk in this province .
O,"We heard about , do you want to meet ?"
O,"I said , of course I do ."
O,So I I went to this little mountain and walked up 2000 steps to the old Cambodian temple ruins at the top .
O,"And there was this very interesting guy who had just finished a couple of years before the first Peace Corps , I think , in Borneo , and then got interested in Buddhism and common ordained as a monk ."
O,And I talk with him .
O,He's now he's named John Tomato is his monk's name because he's still a monk .
O,Can you became quite famous in Thailand and then became the abbot of a Temple Inn in England ?
O,"And I became friends with him and he said , oh , I found I found a really fine teacher ."
O,"He said , you know , a lot of them , they can take you ."
O,You're a Westerner and they treat you special .
O,He said this guy doesn't treat you any differently than anyone else .
O,"He just wants you to do the work , you know , and learn , learn , learn the deepest way you can ."
O,And he's in this forest jungle .
O,"And I said , I'm going there ."
O,"So having heard that , I went and I visited Ijaw Shah and he was a little bit like the Dalai Lama ."
O,"He was funny and wise and very warm hearted , but also very strict and very demanding ."
O,But he did it in this loving way .
O,"And I thought , OK , this is the real deal ."
O,This guy looks like like what I was reading about and all those Zen stories .
O,"So I've I've read that he said to you , and I'd love for you to tell us when he said this to you ."
O,I hope you're not afraid to suffer if that's true .
O,When did he say that and why did he say that ?
O,He so I'd visited him a number of times and told him I was going to become a monk .
O,And then I ordained in a village where I was living in the Peace Corps .
O,People wanted me to do that .
O,It was a beautiful ritual .
O,"And then after some days , I made my way down to his temple and he said , that's me ."
O,That was his opening gambit .
O,I'm walking into the gates and I see him .
O,I vow as I am here .
O,"And he looks at me , you know , leans back a little , little skeptical ."
O,"He said , All right , I hope you're not afraid to suffer ."
O,Welcome .
O,"And it was it was a it was like , you know , you didn't come here just to kind of do some interesting , cool anthropological experiment or something like that ."
O,"If you're going to do it , we're going to put you through the training ."
O,And and and he did .
O,"But , you know , there was like this little smile as he said it , like , OK , you are you up for it ?"
O,"All right , dude ."
O,Come on in .
O,What did what did the training consist consist of ?
O,What were what were some of the first things that you had to do ?
O,And then what ?
O,What was the suffering that he alluded to ?
O,What were some exam ?
O,"Well , maybe some examples ."
O,"OK , so of course , the first training was just how to walk around and not have my robe , you know , fall on the ground and embarrass me and everything to hold ."
O,That helps .
O,So they all loved it .
O,"Oh , yeah ."
O,Right .
O,Look at the Western .
O,"You can't even see gunmen , whereas robes ."
O,Right .
O,Or whatever .
O,So part of it was just the unfamiliarity of it culturally and otherwise .
O,Right .
O,There were there were the two kinds of suffering .
O,"The big suffering , of course , was being alone with my own mind ."
O,"I mean , there you go ."
O,"You know , having to do hours of meditation when I didn't know what the hell I was doing ."
O,"And then as I talked about with anger or fear or confusion or , you know , all those kind of states learning to deal in a very conscious and mindful way ."
O,"And then more importantly , in a compassionate way , in a kind and loving way , with all the energies that make up my humanity and our humanity ."
O,"And that means when you sit and you get quiet , anything unfinished in your heart will also come up all the unfinished business ."
O,"So , you know , relationships that I've had that ended badly in college or or certainly stuff from my childhood and family , dreams that I carried , things fulfilled and not all that comes up ."
O,It's .
O,Yeah .
O,"My friend Annie Le Mott , humorist and writer , says , my mind is like a bad neighborhood ."
O,I try not to go there alone .
O,And there's some way in which in communities sitting together with others in meditation and then sitting in my heart .
O,It was really facing myself and my whole humanity .
O,"That was that that was probably the most difficult thing , because then you get insanely bored or insanely restless or ."
O,And then how do you deal with all those energies ?
O,"Normally , when we're restless or bored , you know , what do we do ?"
O,"You know , open the refrigerator or , you know , go online or something , because we can't be with our own loneliness or our own fear ."
O,So it was the inner .
O,And then there's the outer border and the outer one .
O,"Yeah , the outhouse ones were things like getting up ."
O,The bell would ring at 3:30 in the morning .
O,And I'm not an early riser .
O,"By nature , I go , oh , god ."
O,Here we go and we walk through .
O,It was actually very beautiful .
O,"Then we'd walk through the forest at night , either by moonlight or sometimes you'd have a tiny little flashlight ."
O,And then one of the forest monasteries where there were a lot of cobras and we'd have a little stick and you'd tap the path so that the snakes would know you were feeling coming and move out of the way .
O,Wouldn't step on them .
O,And then we would sit silently for a couple of hours and then do an hour of chanting on a hard stone floor .
O,"Mind you , everybody else seemed comfortable in my body ."
O,It was killing me .
O,"And then at least once a week , we would sit up all night with the teacher and he would sit there comfortably , meditating , maybe talking with another colleague that would come ."
O,"And we'd just be sitting and meditating and he would kind of peek over at us like , how are you doing ?"
O,"I go , Oh , God ."
O,It's been four hours .
O,When are we when is he going to let us go back to sleep ?
O,"And he didn't , you know , so staying up all night ."
O,It got very cold .
O,The cold season and it got insanely hot in the hot season .
O,"And somehow learning to live extremely simply with a set of sandals and a set of robes and an arms bowl , and then you would eat what you got offered in the village and we would share it in that monastery with others around us ."
O,And sometimes you'd get nice food .
O,"And a lot of times in the dry season , you'd get really , really skimpy food ."
O,There wasn't that much to eat .
O,"And so picture a day where you get up at 3:30 in the morning , you know , you sit for a couple of hours in meditation and do a lot more than an hour long chanting on a stone floor ."
O,"Then it's getting dark and you walk barefoot , you know , three miles , five miles , 10 miles with a alms bowl and a handful of other monks and get your food and come back whatever you've been offered ."
O,And that's the food for the day .
O,And then you go back to your meditation or to the work of the monastery of sewing robes or drawing water from the well .
O,"And it's , you know , muggy and one hundred and five degrees hot season ."
O,And then you go back and you join in the community for more meditation .
O,"And then the teacher smiles and say , how are you doing , you know ?"
O,And then other kinds of practices .
O,"For example , we had a child ground there ."
O,And so sorry .
O,"What a charnel ground , which is where a cremation ground where people bodies would be burned and so on occasion would go to a cremation and then sit up all night and contemplate death ."
O,Mm hmm .
O,"And , you know , look at the body and then watch as it burned and then do these meditations where you would reflect on , well , this is going to happen to the body that you're inhabiting as well ."
O,Who do you think you are ?
O,"Do you think you're this physical body made of , you know , hamburgers or lettuce or whatever you have to eat ?"
O,"Is that you or are you hamburgers and let us know or where are you , your feelings or are you your thoughts ?"
O,Who are you really born into this body like koans ?
O,So anyways .
O,And the arms bowl .
O,So you'd be .
O,Did you eat whatever you gathered in one meal ?
O,Was it spread throughout the whale ?
O,"One meal you eat , one meal a day , which makes you very easy to makes your life easy ."
O,"And at the same , at that monastery , things were shared ."
O,There was other monasteries I stayed in where you would just eat what was put in your own bowl and you didn't have to eat everything that was given to you .
O,"There were some things that were , you know , in the dry poor season that there would be curries that were too hot for me to eat because they use the chilies to kind of preserve the preserve , preserve the food ."
O,"But , you know , when when it was a really poor village or something , you know , they would have to make curries out of field mice or field to el-Zour bat or bats or you know , I remember eating ."
O,There was a curry that was made out of basically the grasshoppers that had come swept through .
O,"And there was this whole big , you know , insect wave of insects that were kind of eating the crops and they collected them all , made a career out of ."
O,"So , you know , this is this is what you get for your food today ."
O,"I think I might take the grasshoppers over the over the bats , but ."
O,"Yeah , but then it's really high space ."
O,You can't tell what it's mystery .
O,That's that's and we all have mystery meat .
O,Middle school anyway .
O,This was like mystery meat on steroids .
O,Exotic mystery meat .
O,What was the what was the longest period of time that you spent in silence during that time in Thailand ?
O,"Well , then I went to a Burmese monastery because I wanted to do this very intense meditative training ."
O,And I spent about 500 days .
O,So less .
O,"Less than a year and a half in silence , with the exception that I would talk to the teacher every couple of days ."
O,"I'd have at little ten minute conversation about what was happening , my meditation and the rest ."
O,I was just sitting and locking .
O,Eighteen hours a day when I could or or so sleeping a little bit .
O,And I remember .
O,"At one point , it was relatively early on I've been sitting and walking in and pushing it ."
O,This young man .
O,Do you know I'm going to get enlightened and all of that ?
O,Not moving .
O,"Sitting with a lot of pain , which is also part of what happened at the forest monastery ."
O,Sitting on a stone floor for hours without moving really had to learn how to deal with your own physical pain .
O,And I was exhausted from sitting and walking in my little heart that I had for that long retreat .
O,"And after a couple of months , I thought , I'm really tired ."
O,I got lie down .
O,"But then I thought , well , but I'm going to nap for very long because I'm I'm on my way to enlightenment ."
O,Whenever I'm going to do this right .
O,"So I said , all right , I'll lie down on the wooden floor rather than on the little map that I had ."
O,Then that way I won't sleep so long .
O,I'm lying there .
O,And then I wake up .
O,"And I get up and I walk very slowly doing this mindful , slow walking to the end of the hut and look out the window toward where some of the other monks in the teachers lives ."
O,"Some way down , some way down through the trees ."
O,And then I turn around and I start walking the other direction in this this meditation hut that I had .
O,"Then you could walk probably it was maybe 15 , 18 feet long ."
O,It was long and narrow .
O,And I see this body lying on the floor .
O,"And all of a sudden I go , oh , that's me ."
O,And then I realized that I'm having an out of the body experience .
O,And what had happened is that I was so intent .
O,I'm not going to sleep long .
O,I'll get up very soon .
O,"That intention was really strong , but my body didn't want to get up ."
O,So I got up .
O,But it was it wasn't in my body .
O,And I walked very slowly and I peered down at my body and I turned around to walk the other walk back .
O,"And then the second time I walked back , I got closer ."
O,And then I fell into my body and I woke up .
O,"Oh , wow ."
O,That's interesting .
O,"But what I saw out the window wasn't just like a dream because I was watching , you know , my teacher and talking to these other monks ."
O,And I got up again .
O,And that's exactly what was happening .
O,And that was the first of a series of all kinds of very interesting experiences that happen .
O,And there's the .
O,Other examples of those types of unusual experiences being in did .
O,Was it your time in Burma that found you experiencing these for the first time ?
O,"Well , first of all , the first experiences , even though I had experiment with meditation back in in in college and so forth , were experiences again that came through psychedelics ."
O,And so I was familiar with all kinds of weird and powerful and mysterious or mystical kind of experiences .
O,But they but there's something about learning how to navigate it without taking a substance and learning that your own consciousness is the field that you can that you can learn to navigate first all the personality and emotions and history and so forth .
O,But then you start to realize that you're bigger than that .
O,That who you are is not just your thoughts and feelings in your mind .
O,"And so whether it's out of body experience or the experience of vastness and becoming the sky within which everything arises and passes or the experience of profound silence or the void where you enter , enter a stillness before experience even arises , or the experience of luminosity where where my body would dissolve into light their time sitting ."
O,"As you get concentrated and somebody your concentration builds that your whole body and mind open up and you know , first you get the elements ."
O,"Your body can feel heavy like a stone the earth element or can feel so light that you have to pick your open your eyes and make sure you're not floating because it feels like you're floating in the air or can be filled with fire and you feel like you're in the middle of a raging fire or can get icy cold , you know , or all kinds of vibrations and kundalini energies and chakras start to open ."
O,And sometimes it's present .
O,Sometimes it's not .
O,"You know , as deep energies start to move through your body , they also kind of push open the places that are held close so that when your heart starts to open in deep meditation , sometimes it feels like you're having a heart attack ."
O,It's physically painful because all the all the things that you've held around your heart to protect yourself start to loosen .
O,"Or when the energy hits your throat and it starts to open , weird sounds come out , you know , and then you get to visions that come in the , you know , brow chakra ."
O,You start to see all kinds of colors and visions and hear things .
O,"All possibilities of the play of consciousness can start to open after both period of silence , but also really deeply training attention and concentration of these experiences ."
O,"Just to put them in , or at least part of what you said in context for people listening ."
O,There are a number of things you mentioned .
O,"But one in particular , that opening in the chest that I experienced in the ten day retreat done at Spirit Rock , which which for which you are one of the instructors of the lead instructor ."
O,And I was an incredibly powerful experience .
O,"And listening to your description of some of the feelings , it makes me want to go to the jungle and and spend time doing this type of training ."
O,"However , the 10 day retreat , as you know from firsthand observation and interacting with me was incredibly difficult for me and terrifying it a number of points where I felt like I had crossed a boundary into maybe even madness , where I I was fearful I wouldn't be able to return from ."
O,"And so I'm curious to know during that period of time in Thailand , in Burma could be afterwards as well ."
O,But when you were in the in the jungle and doing this very intense work .
O,Were there any particular points when you wanted to quit to go to go home ?
O,Absolutely .
O,"I mean , that I remember I I got what I think was malaria ."
O,I had a really high fever and I was sick as a dog .
O,"And I'm lying in the bottom of my little hot there , high fever and shivering ."
O,And Ajin child came to visit me and in the Lao language .
O,And he was he was also funny and quite blunt .
O,And the Lao language is a very straightforward kind of that sentence structures are pretty simple .
O,"So he looked at me and he said , sic ha ."
O,"And I said , yeah , and he's it hurts all over , huh ?"
O,"I said , it sure does ."
O,"He said , hon ."
O,Cold .
O,Yeah .
O,"He said , you know , makes you afraid ."
O,I notice it makes you want to go home and see your mother does it .
O,And I not there .
O,"And then he looked at me and he said , you know , this is the jungle fever ."
O,This is malaria .
O,We've all had it .
O,But now there's some good medicine .
O,I'll send the medicine monk over and in a couple of days you'll be fine .
O,"And then he looked at me and he said , you can do this ."
O,"You know , you can do this ."
O,"So , I mean , that was an example of what ?"
O,But what am I doing ?
O,What kept you ?
O,What kept you going ?
O,"I mean , I don't interrupt ."
O,"It's like , what kept you going ?"
O,I'm imagining 500 days of silence .
O,I could barely handle 10 days .
O,"You know , Tim , I mean , what's kept you going ?"
O,What keeps any of us going about things that we care about ?
O,"I had somehow I don't know what kind of a wacky , but I think also important kind of passion to say ."
O,"I want to understand or I you know , I've started down this road and I want to see where it goes ."
O,"And I think all of us find at a certain point in our life that there are , if we're lucky , that something really matters ."
O,And you've done it in your work and your travel .
O,You want to explore what your human capacity is .
O,And I'd read or read these old Zen stories .
O,And I want to see if this is true .
O,I want to find out .
O,"And then as I started , things start to happen like that out of the body , experience and rapture and changes and and openings ."
O,And I realized there was really something to learn here .
O,But there are a couple other things that I want to add to this .
O,One of them that's the most important is that it turns out that it wasn't and it isn't so much about the actual experiences .
O,"So Örjan charm , my teacher talked about how in his own training for the first eight years in the jungle , he had been a very ardent meditator and had all kinds of insights and dissolving and samadhi and Johnna experiences ."
O,All kinds of symmetry .
O,Is a week in embodies .
O,Yeah .
O,Or there on it .
O,"How would you turn down somebody who has a lot of meanings as a word , but it it can mean profound states of concentration in which the mind dissolves into light or into joy or bliss or becomes absorbed with anyone of all kinds of states ."
O,"So we went to the most famous teacher of that time , another odd young gentleman , and told him about all these experiences , and the master looked back and said , Chas , you missed the point ."
O,These are just experiences .
O,"You know , it's like gone to the movies ."
O,"And you have a romantic comedy and you have a war movie and you have a documentary , you know , and you have , you know , Disney movies ."
O,"And they're just movies on the screen , some pleasant , some unpleasant ."
O,The only question is to whom do they happen ?
O,Turn your attention back and ask .
O,Look to see who is the witness of these .
O,What is the consciousness that is knowing these ever changing experiences ?
O,"This is where your liberation will come , he said ."
O,Become his language .
O,"If I translate , it is the one who knows , become the knowing rather than the experiences ."
O,"And then you can tolerate anything , and you can respond with love and understanding because you rest in the timeless consciousness , which is your true nature ."
O,"So part of what I also learned in meditation and teach is that it's not so much about the experience as Oh , I want to have this or that experience , but it's this profound turning back to ask who am I ?"
O,What is this consciousness itself ?
O,And that was born into this body that will leave it .
O,We can talk about death at some point if you want .
O,What is this mysterious consciousness itself ?
O,So there is that .
O,"And then that also had the opportunity of being with a few other teachers and more of my mother , of people that I was very close to and who inspired me profoundly was a Cambodian monk named Margot Sonando , who was the Gandhi of Cambodia ."
O,"And when I met him , we were living and training together in a forest monastery in Thailand ."
O,And it was during the time the Khmer Rouge came to power and eventually killed two million Cambodians in a kind of genocide .
O,And he was he survived because he wasn't in country .
O,But all 19 of his family members were killed .
O,His temple burned .
O,"You know , all the all the Buddhist texts and so forth were destroyed ."
O,"When he was able to , he went to the refugee camps ."
O,Refugees were pouring out of Cambodia by the hundreds of thousands .
O,And he went to the refugee camps on the border of Thailand and Cambodia .
O,And I was able to go with him .
O,"And at a certain point , he decided to open a temple in the middle of one of the biggest refugee camps here is 50 or 100 thousand people ."
O,These tiny little bamboo huts and got permission from the UN HCR High Commissioner for Refugees and built a platform with a little roof over it and put an altar with the traditional Cambodian Buddha on it and so forth .
O,But it was a camp with the Khmer Rouge underground .
O,Lots of them .
O,"And so they put the word out that if anyone went to be with this monk when they got out of the camp back to Cambodia , they would all be shot ."
O,So we wondered who would if anyone would come and .
O,"Went through the camp the day , the opening day with a big kind of temple gong ringing it and twenty five thousand people poured into the central square around this little temple , my God ."
O,And he Longo's and on this out there and he was a scholar .
O,He spoke fifteen languages .
O,"And he was a , you know , extremely kind hearted human being who had suffered enormously and had transformed it into the kind of compassion that we think of with the Dalai Lama or something like that ."
O,"In fact , they became friends and ghost and other became the head of all Cambodian bosom ."
O,But there he was at this point sitting looking out at twenty five thousand people who had suffered immense traumas .
O,And you could see there was a grandmother and the only two surviving grandchildren that she had or an uncle and one niece .
O,And their faces were the faces of trauma and survivors .
O,"And I thought , all right , what is he going to say to them ?"
O,And he sat very quietly for a long time just in their presence .
O,And then he put his hands together in this kind of modest way and began to chant in the microphone .
O,"He had a sound system in Cambodian and in Sanskrit or Polli , the Buddhist language ."
O,"One of the first versus from the Buddhist texts that goes hatred never ceases by hatred , but by love alone is healed ."
O,This is the ancient and eternal law .
O,"And he chanted it over and over in Cambodian and in Sanskrit , Polli ."
O,And pretty soon the chant was picked up .
O,"And in a little while , twenty five thousand people were chanting this verse with him ."
O,And I looked out and they were weeping .
O,"Many of them , because they hadn't heard their sacred chants for years , but also because he was offering them a truth that was even bigger than their sorrows ."
O,"That hatred never ends by hatred , but by love alone is healed ."
O,This is the ancient and eternal law .
O,"And they were sitting in the middle of the the the healing energy of the dharma , of the teachings of the heart that can liberate us later on ."
O,"Go Sonando , who is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize a number of times , spent fifteen years walking through the killing fields and , you know , mined areas and so forth , leading people on foot back to their village ."
O,"And he said to the refugees , you can't go back in a bus or the back of a truck or something like that ."
O,You have to reclaim your land with love .
O,And so he would lead a thousand people and he'd be in the front with a bell and a gong and a few other monks .
O,"And the whole way back , they would be chanting the chants of loving kindness ."
O,"So that by the time they got to their village , whatever had been destroyed , there was this sense that they were reclaiming not just the land , but they were reclaiming their own hearts ."
O,That's a beautiful .
O,Really beautiful story .
O,And it it prompts me to ask a question that I struggle with answering myself .
O,And it's also a question many of my friends have asked themselves and I'll take a stab at it .
O,How do you decide when to do ?
O,Deep inner work and take an extended period to do that versus being in the world and trying to impact others and the world and to just provide a little bit of background on that .
O,I have friends who are building businesses or building careers of some type or families .
O,"And I at this point do not have wife , kids or company to build , at least with a large organization ."
O,"And I've come back from various experiments , sojourns experiences over weeks or months and shared these with them ."
O,"And they've they've expressed this longing , this deep yearning to do something similar ."
O,"And then they ask this question like , how do I ."
O,How do I best decide ?
O,"If and when to do the deep extended work versus being in the world , and I know it might be a false dichotomy , you might not have to choose ."
O,But I'll talk a little bit more just just to fill the space .
O,But the .
O,"I had this experience personally not long ago when I was in South America and had someone telling me in second in Spanish , which was not their native language ."
O,An indigenous tribe .
O,"But this uppal , this mayor effectively , who worked a lot with different planet medicines ."
O,"And he said that he recommended one 15 month diet , very , very strict 15 month period with many different restrictions , no sex , no alcohol , no pork , etc. And to develop certain capacities and to practice in effect , I mean , at certain types of meditative practices ."
O,So I struggle with this myself as well .
O,How do you how do you suggest someone think through ?
O,So did you give up sex in the park ?
O,I've done it for short periods of time .
O,I'm not a year and a half .
O,"I've done it for weeks at a time , but not for fifteen months ."
O,But what appealed to me about that ?
O,Definitely not the lack of sex and pork .
O,I like both of those things .
O,"It was he said , that's something you only have to do once in your life , and it opens doors and creates opportunities that are difficult , if not impossible to achieve otherwise ."
O,"So of course , that's very tantalizing ."
O,"But 15 months is a really , really long time to opt out of everything else ."
O,And I'm not saying it has to be 15 months for some people .
O,"As you know , setting aside even 10 days to do a solitary is hard ."
O,"And I know there are things that they can do on an ongoing basis , like morning meditation and so on ."
O,"But for those who are really drawn to this extended deeper work , how do you think about ."
O,And that's why it goes on under .
O,Brought it up for me .
O,He'd spent so much time outside of his country that went back and was really on the on the ground doing work with locals had .
O,How do you think about that or suggest someone think about it ?
O,"First , my answer is yes , because all of the things that you say are true , that , yes , there , you know , most cultures encourage at some point human beings , most wise cultures , even beings to step out of their ordinary roles and their ordinary routine , whether you go to the mountains or the ocean , you know , or a temple or change how you're living so that you can open up to the mystery and so that you also can open up to love ."
O,Because what I saw with my teachers and go sonando as wife and child .
O,Another is that they were able to love no matter what it was really because they they inhabited consciousness in a very different way than just a small sense of self .
O,That was something much a possibility that we could live with forgiveness and love and be really effective in the world at the same time .
O,So they're not separate .
O,And that's sort of what your question is how do we live in the world ?
O,"And at the same time , you know , what trainings and how do we connect with something deeper ?"
O,And part of it is just intuitive .
O,"You know , Tim , if you have new more and , you know , or young children and so forth , it's not the time to go on a long retreat ."
O,Your kids are your practice .
O,"And in fact , you can't get a Zen master who's going to be more demanding than , you know , an infant with colic ."
O,Right .
O,Who are you ?
O,"Or you know , or a teenage , you know , certain teenage kids where you ."
O,"But with the young ones , you know , you're Zen master might say you've got to get up early in the morning and , you know , once in a while you might roll over ."
O,"The kid is crying and say , you have to get up ."
O,Your family needs tending .
O,"And , you know , if you're even vaguely a responsible and caring parent as you get , that becomes your practice ."
O,"And if you think , well , if only I could be in the greats and temple of Kyoto or an ashram in India or down in the Amazon with Tim , you know , taking ayahuasca or whatever that plant medicine they get , you know , your kid is can be like ayahuasca on steroids , OK ?"
O,"You want to you want to face yourself and your own limitations and your own you know , you want to look at the small sense of self and find out how to live with it with a freer and bigger spirit ."
O,Here we just hired someone to live with you and train you for it .
O,"So it's really , you know , and that's an important thing ."
O,"But but what makes it work is that you have that intention not just to soldier through it , but to say let this be a place where I awaken graciousness and inner sense of freedom and peace ."
O,As things come and go where I awaken the possibility of presence in pleasure and pain and joy and sorrow and gain and loss and all the changes that I find .
O,"And inviolable or a timeless place of becoming the loving witness of it all , becoming the loving awareness that says , yeah , now I'm having a family experience and this is the place to find freedom , because freedom is not in the Himalayas or in the Amazon ."
O,The only place it's found is in your own heart exactly where you are .
O,And that's what goes on to talk and wonder what Örjan char .
O,That's really what they wanted to communicate .
O,"Now , that being said , if you have an opportunity and you're drawn to it like somebody you might do , you know Jack Dorsey ?"
O,I do .
O,I do know Jack Kim .
O,So Jack just did his first 10 day meditation retreat .
O,Good for him .
O,"And he tweeted about I wouldn't say it otherwise , but he tweeted about it ."
O,"And it was , you know , one of the top transformative experiences of his life ."
O,And it's not to say 10 day retreats are the be all and end all they are .
O,They are very powerful and compelling .
O,"But you even if you have a company or even if you have a family , there might be a period of a week or some days where you can , in fact , get away and step out of those roles and turn inward ."
O,And that can be tremendously valuable .
O,So I think both are important .
O,You just have to listen what when the time is right .
O,So there are so many things that this this brings up .
O,"The first , though , is just a housekeeping for people who may not recognize the name Jack Dorsey ."
O,That's Jack Jack .
O,I believe it is on Twitter of you might then wonder how did he get that user handle ?
O,Well .
O,His is one of the people behind Twitter .
O,So he is of Twitter .
O,And square fame among many others .
O,"Fascinating , fascinating guy ."
O,So people can check him out .
O,"The comment on the infant being the full time trainer working with you 24/7 reminded me also since you mentioned Ramadoss earlier of a quote of his that I like and I'm going to paraphrase , I'm sure ."
O,"But if you think you're enlightened , go spend a week with your family ."
O,Which I think is a fantastic one .
O,And that's part of the reason .
O,"And , you know , some of the backstory ."
O,But we all have I would imagine we all have tough things that happen to us experienced Trump traumatic experiences as children have a lot of triggers related to family members typically .
O,"And for me , the forced to break takes a number of different forms ."
O,"But that includes a trip every six months , an extended trip of two to four weeks with my parents and my brother when he can make it ."
O,"So that's only after being introduced to meditation , something that I would even consider as a practice ."
O,And the the last point I'll I'll mentioned just out of my personal experience is that a there's a piece of paper I have in my wallet and I've had my wallet for a few years now .
O,It's getting bit worn down .
O,It's a piece of construction paper and an ex girlfriend gave it to me who who knew me very well .
O,And it says the task that hinders your task is your task .
O,Beautiful .
O,And that's a good reminder for me .
O,"I wanted to ask you two questions that are personally important , but but also may apply to other people ."
O,"The first is the question that I believe you mentioned , orgin Cha , perhaps others have indicated is the question versus the the experiences or movies of these say out-of-body experiences and so on ."
O,To whom do they happen ?
O,Right .
O,To whom do they happen ?
O,Is this a koan like what is the sound of one hand clapping where there isn't really an answer you're ah you're expected to arrive at ?
O,Is it is the value in contemplating the question more than any answer ?
O,Yes .
O,Both .
O,No course .
O,Yes or no ?
O,Yeah .
O,Because it is .
O,It's a profound contemplation for us .
O,"One of the great , you know , questions of human incarnation ."
O,Who are we ?
O,How do we get into it ?
O,How did you get in this body with the wiggly things on the end of your limbs ?
O,"You know , the face of the claws that you have , you know , as nails and a vestigial tail ."
O,And that hole at one end into which you've stopped dead plants and animals and glug them down through the tube .
O,"I mean , the whole incarnation thing is really pretty wild ."
O,So who are we ?
O,And then what are what how do we make meaning of what this is ?
O,This is a lifetime question in that way .
O,"It's a koan , but in another way , it also actually does have any answer ."
O,"And the answer , of course , has to be found by each person ."
O,The answer to point toward it .
O,"It's very clear that you're not just your , you know , salad and vegetables and hamburger body ."
O,"And you're not just your emotions , I hope , because they're always changing in your thoughts ."
O,Good God .
O,I hope you're not your thoughts .
O,"So you start to realize , all right , what is there then ?"
O,What is this self ?
O,Who am I in neuroscience ?
O,"You know , there was a Time magazine issue on modern neuroscience where it said neuroscientists have searched throughout the brain over many decades now and come to the clued conclusion that they cannot find this self located anywhere in the neural mechanisms of the brain and that it simply does not exist ."
O,But what does exist is a sense of self that's built out of a sense of identification with our thoughts and body and so forth .
O,That's all wise and appropriate .
O,"We should be , but we also know that it's not the end of the story ."
O,"And you know , from walking in the high mountains or listening to an extraordinary piece of music or making a log or taking some some sacred medicine , you know , we're sitting at the bedside of someone when they die , that mysterious moment when spirit leaves the body or when a child is born ."
O,"We have these moments where we open to mystery and realize that who we are is not just our personal history or our body and emotions , that we become the consciousness itself , the witnessing awareness that we are a loving awareness that was born into this body ."
O,And that becomes actually a direct knowing and direct experience .
O,So there is a .
O,A way in which we also can come home to ourselves .
O,And it brings a tremendous sense of freedom and well-being as all the movies of ever changing life happen to us .
O,So that's why I said yes .
O,Yes and no .
O,And both .
O,"And as I said a little aside , thinking about you going back to your family practice at least twice a year as you're doing ."
O,I just want to remind you and the listeners that Buddha and Jesus both had a hard time when they went back to their family .
O,"So I don't think that , you know , there's something wrong with you ."
O,It's just part of it .
O,So that's why they call it nuclear family .
O,"I think , anyway , that the there's another I guess it's a word more than a question that I'd love to ask you to define ."
O,And that is compassion or compassionate when you use that word or those words .
O,What do you mean exactly ?
O,Or what would you like it to mean for people ?
O,I would like to just English compassion from empathy .
O,And I'll use a simple illustration .
O,"If you're on the playground and you see a kid being bullied and you feel , oh , that must feel terrible , that hurts ."
O,Right ?
O,That's an empathy .
O,And empathy can be useful .
O,It also can be you can get overwhelmed by empathy if you don't know what to do with it .
O,But there is some way in which you start to feel resonate in you because we are not limited to these bodies .
O,We are actually a an interconnected system of consciousness .
O,And I'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute .
O,But we all know whether it's mirror neurons from neuroscience or the field of presences as neuro .
O,"You know , scientists like Dan SIEGEL talk about extended presence , that we can feel empathy with one another ."
O,"When someone says someone's angry , someone's hurting ."
O,Compassion is the next step .
O,"You you see or recognize , you feel ."
O,And then you care who you care about it .
O,"And you want to if you can do something that helps so that you see that kid being bullied and you realize , I want to tell the teacher or the principal or I want to just walk over there and say something or intervene to help stop it ."
O,"And so compassion , it's called the quivering of the heart when it wants to move to alleviate the suffering of yourself because you can have self-compassion ."
O,It's very important .
O,Or those around you .
O,And it's born into the earliest studies of infants .
O,"You know , at Yale and various places like that show that even very , very , very small children have this resonance ."
O,And this kind of care .
O,And so it's not shut down in us .
O,We we're a species that's interconnected and we care for one another .
O,"And this is your birthright , this natural , natural compassion ."
O,"And through practice and meditation , you can reawaken it , you can extend it , and it can become your way of living and moving in the world as a little aside ."
O,And just bookmark this one .
O,"Just got back from a conference with our dear friend Adam Ghazali , our mutual friend Richie Davidson , who's another the most famous neuroscientists , especially in this area , and a number of other some contemplative US and neuroscientists and some technologists from the Valley NBC talking about how to build compassion into our interface with the technological world , compassion ."
O,"And then from starting from the very simplest things of projects like can you build a Fitbit for compassion , where instead of your body , where you can either know moments of care around you or in yourself or be prompted to care for yourself , you know , or when you say to Siri or Alexei , you know , I'm feeling lonely or , you know , and so forth ."
O,"What kind of response do you get from them , from the algorithms and all of that ?"
O,"Well , because the UK England just appointed their first minister of loneliness for the country ."
O,"And I think it was a joke , but it's not like an old Beatles song ."
O,"All the lonely people there , 10 million lonely people in England , they've estimated ."
O,And this minister has got cut .
O,"And it's , you know , it's isolation and loss of capacity and health and all kinds of reasons that loneliness makes things way worse ."
O,But .
O,There's some way in which compassion is that which connects us .
O,"And it's a beautiful thing , even if you walk down the street and you see someone , you know , who's struggling and so forth ."
O,Doesn't mean you have to fix the whole world .
O,That's not your job .
O,That would be egotistical .
O,But you can reach your hand out and mend the things that you can .
O,"You contend the things that you can and you can do it not because , oh , you pity them , those poor people , but because they're your family ."
O,You recognize that we're common humanity .
O,We're in this together .
O,Yes .
O,I'd like to .
O,Build on that and preface it with a comment on the taxi you mentioned .
O,Collaborating with Adam and Braley's discussing the potential of combining or utilizing technology to help people to develop and harness compassion .
O,"And some folks listening might be like , oh , come on , that's so pie in the sky ."
O,"But I'd like to point out that you've already collaborated successfully with Adam on software like Metatron , MDI , TR A.I. and which was one of the tools Adam has used in his end of one and of two experiments in rejuvenating his mental capacity to , I want to say , in his 20s ."
O,"And Adams Adams , one of those guys , you can't tell if he's 28 or 45 ."
O,He's just the silver fox always looks young .
O,"So I don't know how old he is , but he's not he's not 22 ."
O,But The Mediterraneo is one of the tools that he utilized .
O,And I don't remember the name that he used for this run of experiments .
O,"You might know that the training that he did , neuro man or something like that , was very , very successful ."
O,So you already have a track record of collaborating successfully with neuroscientists and technologists .
O,"The on the the compassion front , I'd love to use that as a segue way to loving kindness ."
O,"And by way of personal example , I failed but failed as a strong word ."
O,I quit .
O,"I stopped meditating after many , many attempts , had a very absurdly high number of false starts over many years ."
O,"And it's it really stuck after a number of experiments and experiences I had doing three or four day trainings with , say , transdermal meditation and having the social accountability ."
O,Being accountable to someone else is very helpful .
O,"But another turning point was experimenting with lovingkindness , meditation , and I think in part it succeeded because it took the focus off of me , me , me , I , I and allowed me to focus on others ."
O,But I'd like to read a brief paragraph from a profile of you in The New York Times from 2014 and feel free to correct anything that is incorrect .
O,But I'll I'll give it a read first .
O,"And I quote in the West Cornfield says , quote , We encounter a lot of intense striving ambition and a lot of self-criticism , self judgment and self-hatred and quote , concerned ."
O,"He initially turned to the Dalai Lama for advice , but self-hatred was such a foreign concept to the Tibetan Buddhist that he wasn't able to offer any real insight ."
O,"Over time , Cornfield and his colleagues began to believe that Americans need particular meditation closely ."
O,I'm sorry .
O,Practice closely linked to the concepts of self forgiveness and loving kindness .
O,"A training and the unconditional acceptance of imperfection without such a foundation , says Cornfield , meditation can easily become ."
O,"And this is the part that I underline and start without this foundation , says Cornfield , meditation can easily become yet another form of striving quote ."
O,Another thing you do to make yourself better and quote instead of a path to true contentment .
O,So could you please describe for folks ?
O,What lovingkindness meditation practice looks like and elaborate in any way that you feel might be might be useful or helpful for folks .
O,Yeah .
O,"And that meeting , which was some decades ago with the Dalai Lama ."
O,Yeah .
O,"He didn't understand when we talked about self-hatred , couldn't you ."
O,There's no word written .
O,Tibetan went back and forth with Tressider .
O,What does this mean ?
O,Fine .
O,"He looked up , he said ."
O,But this is a mistake .
O,Why would anyone do this ?
O,"But Lenny asked , how many of you ?"
O,"There was a group of us who were teachers who had experienced this , and almost everyone raised their hand ."
O,"So we see that when people begin in our culture and in the West to meditate or to turn in turn inward , really , that it's very common to encounter a lot of self-criticism , self judgment or even self-hatred ."
O,"And , you know , there all the causes from our these are all kind of conditioning that we got from them , from our childhood , our education and so forth ."
O,"But what it means is that you're sitting there saying , I'm not doing it right ."
O,I'm no good .
O,"You turn meditation into one other one other thing that you don't do , right , because you can't control your mind ."
O,The truth is that you can't control your mind easily .
O,That's not the point .
O,"There is a different way of approaching your mind , which gives you tremendous capacities ."
O,But it's not .
O,"Oh , I have to stop my thinking or I don't want to have these feelings ."
O,And I hate having all these judgments .
O,"I don't want to be so judged mililani that well , I hate this ."
O,Judging by what is it ?
O,It's just more judgment .
O,"So instead , as you become first able to become the loving witness , the the mindful , loving awareness that says , oh , this is the judging mind and it's been trying to protect me , thank you for trying to protect me ."
O,I don't need you now .
O,Thank you .
O,"All of a sudden , there's a distance from the from the painful or destructive or or self critical thoughts simply by witnessing and with loving awareness and acknowledging them ."
O,This becomes the gateway to the practice of loving kindness and self self-compassion .
O,And very often people can't do it for themselves .
O,They feel that's too much of a stretch .
O,"Like , why would I wish myself well ?"
O,It feels egotistical .
O,And so the way that this practice begins for skillfully for four such folks is instead to think of someone that you really care about a lot .
O,"And to picture them , remember them , put them in your mind's eye and feel the kind of well-wishing you would want for them ."
O,"You know , may they be protected and safe from difficulty ."
O,"May they be held in loving kindness , may they be well or healthy , strong and you wish them ."
O,That may be happy .
O,"And you do this for a time , a kind of inner well-wishing ."
O,"And also , maybe you feel as you think of this person that you care about , you let yourself also tune into the measure of sorrows ."
O,"They have the struggles that every human being has , you know , and a tenderized as your heart as you think of them , because you don't want them to suffer ."
O,You feel a kind of rising of compassion and care .
O,"So may they hold themselves in compassion , may be safe and protected and well , and you do that with one or two people that you care about for a time ."
O,"And then you can imagine , even as I'm describing this and you following your own heart , you can imagine these ."
O,To more loved ones .
O,"Looking back at you with the same kindness and saying just as you wish us protection and safety and happiness and well-being and you know and compassion , they gaze at you and they say , you , too ."
O,May you be safe and protected .
O,May you be filled with tender compassion for yourself and kindness .
O,"May you to be healthy and well , may you be happy ."
O,They want you to be happy .
O,I think about it when I'm doing this .
O,I'm visualizing some loved ones .
O,"And I know that as I do it , I can feel they want that for me ."
O,"And then finally , as you feel that from these loved ones , you can put your hand on your body or your heart , even if you like , and take it in and then begin to realize that you can wish this for yourself ."
O,May I hold all of the joys and sorrows of my life with tenderness and kindness ?
O,May I hold my struggles with compassion ?
O,May I be filled with loving kindness and loving awareness ?
O,May I be safe and protected ?
O,"May I be , well , strong or healed ?"
O,And as you repeat these simple intentions that have been done for thousands of years .
O,It's as if your cells are listening .
O,And this is the research of people like Liz Blackburn and the list Apple .
O,Who ?
O,Hoo !
O,Blackburn got the Nobel Prize for discovering telomerase and the telomeres at the end of the caps and DNA .
O,It turns out that your cells listen to your heart and to your intention that consciousness affects your body .
O,"And little by little , even though it can bring up its opposite ."
O,I hate myself .
O,I've never be good enough .
O,And you see all those and you say thank you for trying to protect me .
O,I appreciate that .
O,May I be well ?
O,May I be safe ?
O,"May I be held in love and little by little , like water on a stone ."
O,"It starts to soften the places that are holding your lack of self forgiveness , your lack of care and loving kindness starts to grow in you ."
O,And it's a very beautiful practice .
O,There's lots of places you can find it on my in my work .
O,And teachers like Sharon Salzberg and Premature Children and Tara Brock and and so forth .
O,"Are there any particular do you have any guided , loving kindness , meditations or audio that you can recommend people listen to ?"
O,I do .
O,And I don't know where they have gone by Web site .
O,"Jack Cornfield , dot com ."
O,I think they will be on there .
O,I do know for sure .
O,Have a whole series of great programs with .
O,Sounds true .
O,"Sounds TrueCar.com that include meditations on the mind vastness , the sky , meditations on compassion and loving kindness ."
O,And I did a book .
O,One of the books I've done is called A Lamp in the Darkness .
O,"And it contains , I think , eight or nine different guided practices that you can get either with it on the c_d_ , but you can get it as a download basically ."
O,And sounds true also has that and has a compassion practice and a grounding practice in a vast sky like mine practice and so forth .
O,"So you so you can look out , look for all of those wonderful Butel thing is that you can learn this ."
O,And I was couple of years ago invited to be part of the first White House Buddhist leadership gathering .
O,"There were one hundred and twenty Buddhist leaders from around the country , from different communities ."
O,I don't think that's going to happen again very soon .
O,But there it was .
O,"And one could hope and we talked and most of the communities did beautiful things that were involved in the soup kitchens and tending the homeless and projects , you know , to support healing for whether it was malaria or there are other diseases in different other parts of the world and so forth ."
O,All kinds of great stuff .
O,And certainly meditation .
O,"And when I got to talk , which was kind of a summary talk to her toward the end of it , I mentioned that in this historical record , whether it's true or not , that the tax and so forth described the Buddha meeting with kings and princes and ministers and so forth ."
O,"And probably if the Buddha were were around now , you'd go to the White House if you were invited and certainly would have bet with Obama ."
O,Who knows now ?
O,And he had advice about why society .
O,"Which he would give to leaders and you'd say if you can train your people to meet one another with respect , to listen , with respect to differences and to come together peacefully listening to one other and then then your society will prosper and not decline ."
O,"And if your society tends the vulnerable among them , the young people , the old people , those who are sick , it will prosper and not decline ."
O,"And if your society tends the environment around it in a healthy way , it will prosper and not decline ."
O,So these are these are principles of compassion and why society that you could read perhaps in a number of great traditions from the Iroquois nation or from the Daoist sages .
O,But here is the beautiful piece .
O,Yes .
O,"These are these are good things , meeting in harmony and discussing in harmony and being respectful for one another and so forth ."
O,"There are practices that you can teach and learn that develop this capacity so that in our elementary schools now , you know , through organizations like Castle , which is a consortium for social emotional learning that's worked in , you know , ten thousand schools ."
O,Kids learn social and emotional learning .
O,They learn compassion .
O,And it changes their lives .
O,They're better academically .
O,"And all these kids carry that , you know , the troubles of our times ."
O,They hear the news .
O,They see the trouble even in their own family to teach you how to steward your own heart from when you're young .
O,"And then these capacities are now be , as we know , mindfulness based stress reduction in clinics and hospitals and businesses ."
O,"And , you know , there's the mindfulness teachers that for the when the Seattle Seahawks won the championship or the the Chicago Bulls and the L.A. Lakers , when there were championship teams , they had a they had a meditation coach , a mindfulness coach , George Mumford , a good friend ."
O,And that these capacities can be learned wherever we are .
O,And they transform our life .
O,It's not just by accident or that you have this beautiful experience on the mountains or making love .
O,But you can make that alive for you through these trainings every day .
O,Every part of your life .
O,"Jack , there is a question I was planning on asking at some point anyway , and I think this is a good Segway , which is how can you get a busy person hooked on mindfulness practice ?"
O,Know it would be a first step or how to start .
O,"And since we're talking about loving kindness , I would like to give a bit of a hard sell for loving kindness ."
O,Meditation is one option because I recall perhaps it was two years ago I was really beating myself up .
O,"And for people who don't know this about me , I've spent the majority of my life being the the my own worst enemy in terms of inner dialogue , be extremely brutal and hypercritical and load some of myself in in so many different respects ."
O,And I was going through a particularly intense and difficult time with that inner critic just ruthlessly beating myself up .
O,"And at that point , another friend of mine , Schade Mantan , who created the search inside yourself , classic Google ."
O,"He was a very early on engineer , which became the most oversubscribed class for employees at Google , recommended that I take a look at lovingkindness , meditation , and I didn't have any particularly sophisticated approach to it , but I decided with nothing to lose and that I was having so much trouble during that period , sitting still and trying to focus on , say , the breath or anything like that , that at night this was happened to coincide with book deadline ."
O,Probably not pure coincidence that my beating myself up was exacerbated during that time .
O,"That was a few years ago , and I began at night in my case in when I would take a shower at night or sit in a sauna ."
O,"I very often go to hotels to write , which is something Maya Angelou and a few others convinced me might be a good idea that I would consider two people just like you had mentioned , two people I really cared for and wish them well ."
O,"That's all I did and cheated , said to me , Meng ."
O,"Usually what I'd call him that at one point a woman in one of his classes had done this for one day at work , every hour on the hour ."
O,She would just look out of her office and wish someone well that she could see in her mind's eye for 60 seconds or so .
O,"And she just she said it was her best day of work in seven years , and I found that unbelievable ."
O,So I decided to try it myself .
O,And that week of just spending maybe two to four minutes at night before going to bed ended up being one of the most blissful weeks in memory .
O,"Certainly at that point in several years , it was really profound and I couldn't pick out any other variable that had changed ."
O,"So for me , I just want to for people who are listening and saying , you know what , I'm type a driven super hyper competitor ."
O,This doesn't apply to me that it very well could apply to you .
O,"And that by taking a little bit of the harmful edge off , you don't automatically remove your competitive edge ."
O,"And in fact , I would argue , just as you mentioned , that the bulls and so on used to have or still do , but used to have a mindfulness coach for competitive advantage , that it can be another tool in your toolkit and doesn't take you out of the game , so to speak ."
O,It just makes you more aware of the games that you're playing .
O,"So that's a long sort of infomercial sales pitch that I wanted to just make sure I got in because I discounted a lot of these practices for a very long time because I thought it would at best be a waste of time and at worse , take away some of my skills or tendencies that allowed me to get to where I am ."
O,So that that that is more of a confessional than a question .
O,But I would love to hear your thoughts .
O,"Any additional thoughts on on lovingkindness , meditation , but also any additional thoughts on how if you wanted to get a a busy , maybe even impatient person hooked on mindfulness practice ."
O,What first steps or approaches you might suggest ?
O,So a lot of different questions sort of woven into what you said .
O,And the first is that there's a kind of misunderstanding in our culture that love is a weakness and it's not .
O,"There is a way in which it's the force that can be probably the only force that can meet the level of aggression or violence and other such things that are happening in , you know , in the world ."
O,It's the power that lets mothers lift cars off their children or let somebody like Dr. Martin Luther King stand .
O,"You know , after his church was bombed and children were killed and say , we will meet your physical violence with soul force , we will not harm you ."
O,"We will love you so deeply that we will not only transform ourselves , but we will transform you in the process ."
O,"And so the notion that love is somehow a weakness , I think we do everything out of love ."
O,We want to be loved .
O,"Even in our , you know , ambition and our desire for for success ."
O,"Underneath it is , you know , we want to be well , we want to be ."
O,Find our happiness .
O,And that's part of part of love .
O,So it's it's actually a power .
O,"And my colleague and friend , Western Iscar went to interview Gary Snyder a couple of years ago ."
O,"Gary is a pure literature , prize winning poet and environmentalist for 50 years , when writing about bio regionalism and one of our great kind of elders in this environmental movement ."
O,"You said , Gary , what do you have to say to us now that oceans are rising , the world climate is changing , you know , hotter and hotter , that species extinction ."
O,"Gary looked back and he said , don't feel guilty if you're going to save it , don't save it out of guilt or anger or fear ."
O,Those are the very things that are actually making the world worse .
O,Save it because you love it .
O,Because it's part of you .
O,Because it and that's the that is the is the power .
O,"Whether you're starting a company , but also it's not just that you you know , some vision ."
O,"Okay , now I'm gonna become this wealthy , you know , Playboy or whatever , you know , zillionaire ."
O,Then what does your life mean for you and what you really want ?
O,"And when you listen , there is something in you and it's part of your birthright to both be able to give your gifts , but also to love and be loved in return ."
O,And that's turns out that it's a power .
O,"So then what you talk about is that it doesn't take much to begin the training and your , you know , two minutes or four minutes in the evening or this woman and her work taking once an hour , you know , 30 seconds or a minute to look at somebody there and offer a well-wishing can transform everything for people who want the practical support because it is hard to do on your own if you go to ."
O,Sounds true .
O,Dot com and look up the programs that I have .
O,"First , there's a 40 day program called Mindfulness Daily , which is fifteen minutes a day or twelve minutes a day depending on the segment ."
O,That book gives instructions in mindfulness loving awareness and loving kindness practice .
O,And it's twelve or fifteen minutes a day .
O,"And by the end of those 40 days , you really have learned the inner skills ."
O,And then it builds up .
O,There's an then a deeper training called power of Awareness .
O,"And for those who are interested , we're about to open an online teacher training for people interested in mindful in passing along mindfulness and loving kindness to others ."
O,"Jack , just to interject for one second for people listening ."
O,"I will also link to all of these resources in the show , notes which you can find at Tim Dot blog , forward slash podcast ."
O,So you don't necessarily have to remember all these things .
O,You can go to the URL .
O,And we will have direct links to these resources .
O,"Sorry to interrupt , Jack ."
O,Just want to make sure people listening and with it .
O,Then there is also of the programs there .
O,"There's one called Guided Meditations that's , you know , a downloaded like ten bucks or something ."
O,"And it has a loving kindness practice compassion , practice of forgiveness practice ."
O,I think it may even have a joy practice and so forth .
O,So you can and it's really helpful to have guided meditations at first because otherwise your attention .
O,We have a very short attention span in modern society .
O,"Albert Einstein , at least according to Scientific American , said if you can drive safely while kissing a girl , you're simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves ."
O,"And then we are in a kind of multitasking world with our devices , and we've forgotten how to tend our own hearts ."
O,"We've forgotten how in some ways to really be present for one another and more importantly , for our own life ."
O,"And so getting guided meditations and is tremendously helpful and doing these little mini practices that you talk about one minute , two minutes , several times a day can transform you ."
O,"Now , I was just going to mention to people also , if you look at behavioral change , if you look at B.J. Fogg , formerly of the Persuasion Laboratory at Stanford , you look at diet , dietary change , any of these things do doing less than you think you're capable of doing is a really good long term strategy in terms of starting off rigging the game so that you can win in the beginning so that your pass fail mark ."
O,"In your mind is a really , really low hurdle ."
O,"So I just wanted to reiterate , guy , beautiful guided meditation ."
O,Don't white knuckle in the beginning make it beautiful easy as possible .
O,And this same principle friend from ancient texts say that you start in the easiest way .
O,"For some people , kindness for themselves seems impossible ."
O,"But then you pick a child you care about or someone else , or even when you do go to yourself , you think of yourself when you are an innocent child and wish yourself well ."
O,"The game is to do where whatever naturally opens the gateway , whatever is the easiest for some people as their dog ."
O,"You come home and you know , the most nonjudgmental being in their life wags its tail and loves you ."
O,"And it doesn't care , you know what's going on in your head ."
O,"So you take the avenue that most naturally opens your heart , and then you do this just a little at a time , as you said ."
O,And it doesn't take long .
O,"But the other thing that's important is that sometimes as you do it , it can actually display or show you the hyper critical nature of your mind ."
O,"The shame that you carry the you know , the self judgment or self loathing ."
O,"And so then you then you say , well , what do you do then ?"
O,Or it brings it brings up its opposite is that's the place that you just breed and hold all that stuff with kindness because this is our humanity and we all have some of that .
O,And the point isn't to get rid of it or judge yourself or having it or trying to fix it .
O,"It's almost as if you put your hand on your heart and you say , you know , this is like mine ."
O,Whole self-compassion of deep training .
O,"This is part of the measure of struggles that I've been given , like every human being ."
O,These things have tried to protect me .
O,"And now I can hold them with tenderness and say , all right , you know , thank you , but I don't need your help anymore ."
O,I can be kind to myself .
O,"And and in that way , you're not trying to fix yourself or perfecta yourself in anything ."
O,You're trying to protect your love .
O,This is Jack .
O,I wanted to give you credit for help that you gave me and also tactical advice that you gave me during the 10 day silent retreat .
O,"You give me a lot , but I wanted to I want to highlight one that's related to what you just said ."
O,"I was going through a very , very difficult time , particularly days 7 , 8 , 9 ."
O,And you you gave me the advice that you just mentioned .
O,"And there's there's one component I want to really underscore for people , and that is when you're , for instance , trying to do loving kindness , meditation , and instead you get the opposite or you get this self ridicule ."
O,Who are you to try to meditate in this self-indulgent way ?
O,"This is ridiculous or this voice starts to pop up that is angry or hateful , whatever might be the process of not simply dismissing it or fighting against it , but recognizing it as a coping strategy that helped you in the past in some way that you developed ."
O,"Because in my case , you know , the rage was a fuel that if I had without which I probably would never have left Long Island , where I had friends who later overdosed on opiates and so on ."
O,So it was a gift in a way and a tool .
O,"And as you said , you can thank that response or that part of yourself and then put it in ."
O,"Remember , you recommended even visualizing and please correct me if I'm wrong or elaborate , but visualize taking that part of you ."
O,"That is a coping strategy , thinking it and then putting it , say , on a shelf where you can use it later if need be ."
O,"Along with , say , other icons or figures who , whether it's Buddha or other that that you recognize as wise ."
O,"And then continuing with the meditation so that thanking that part of yourself for the function that it once served , even if it is not serving you now , was such a key insight for me that then helped me to manage my internal states or or observe and appreciate my internal states for the next several days where I really felt like I was lost at that point ."
O,So that was a really direct tool that helped me tremendously .
O,Thank you for bringing it up because it's so important for people .
O,"When we come to that hypercritical shame , a shame place where we feel very vulnerable and we've been identified with it because you needed it ."
O,I needed these things for survival .
O,So .
O,"And if you try to get rid of this stuff , you just end up in a fruitless battle against yourself ."
O,And it's just more judgment .
O,So what you described it saying thank you for helping me survive .
O,I appreciate it .
O,Let me put it on the shelf for the .
O,"I'll put it in the lap of the Budo or whoever , you know , the goddess of infinite compassion , you hold it for me ."
O,"If I need it , I'll pull it back ."
O,And that sense that this isn't who you are .
O,It doesn't describe who you are .
O,It isn't who you are .
O,It was .
O,It was a strategy because we're vulnerable beings .
O,"And you were tender as a child , you know ."
O,And you had to make sure you could survive .
O,Thank you for that .
O,And now I have a different capacity .
O,"And let me just talk about that capacity a little bit , because the capacity for presence and a great heart of compassion that's said to be your birthright ."
O,Is it really mysterious thing ?
O,Talk about identity .
O,"And when my youngest brother's wife , Esther , was dying of cancer and choose just a beautiful being and I spent quite a bit of time with her and with my brother , I had gone home ."
O,She was close to dying .
O,I'd gone home to sleep .
O,And I want to get up early and hurry back because it was very close and I got my car .
O,"I had to stop at the drugstore to pick up a prescription , hurriedly running , you know , dashing through the aisles and so forth ."
O,And I'm at the checkout counter and all of a sudden my whole body relaxed .
O,"And I thought , oh , Esther died ."
O,And I got out to the car and I called my brother .
O,"I said , How's it going ?"
O,"He said , oh , Esther died a few minutes ago ."
O,"And I said , I know , you know , I'll be there shortly ."
O,And we've all had these experiences .
O,"If I ask in a room how many have had this particular kind where you knew someone died when they died , you know , a quarter of the hands will go up ."
O,Why is this ?
O,It's because who we are is not this body .
O,We are we are the consciousness itself .
O,"And so with all these practices , what they allow us to do is to step out of what's called the small sense of self or the body of fear and reconnect with with a field of connection , of interdependence , of compassion ."
O,"And to take our history and to honor it , but not be bound by it ."
O,"One of my favorite stories is around us again , the wonderful spiritual teacher in the early years when he came back from being with his guru in India ."
O,"He was sitting up there and teaching , you know , devotional practices and meditation practices ."
O,And he had a beard and white robes and beads .
O,And he's sort of in the guru outfit .
O,"And a woman in the front row raised their hand and say , round that's around us ."
O,Aren't you Jewish ?
O,What's with this Hindu stuff ?
O,"And Rhonda said , Well , yes , I am ."
O,"Actually , I was bar mitzvahed this as I was , too ."
O,"And there are many things I love about the Jewish spiritual tradition , the generosity of it , the the Kabbalah , all the great , you know , teachings on the many stages and states of consciousness , the Hasidic masters who are like Zen masters ."
O,"And then he paused and looked down and he said , But remember , I'm only Jewish on my parents' side ."
O,"And there is something both me which he was but also profound about it , because we are not just our parental history or the historical circumstances of this place and body that we were born into ."
O,"And something in us knows this so that when you look at there's a wonderful book that came out last year or the year before called The Book of Joy , which was a conversation between the DA Lama and Archbishop Tutu ."
O,And both of them have marvellous laughs .
O,"I think people go to hear the Dalai Lama by the tens of thousands , not just for the Tibetan teaching , some of which are actually hard to understand or even the fact that he this Nobel Prize winning , you know , world figure ."
O,"I think people go to hear him laugh that somebody who's carried so much suffering from the loss of his country where he can't return , and the burning of temples and texts and all of those things ."
O,"And he and to two had a week together when they were asked and in this created this book , how can you be joyful ?"
O,How can you laugh like this when you've lived through apartheid and the death of so many people around you ?
O,"And Dalai Lama , they banter back and forth and like brothers and misses ."
O,So much has been taken from me .
O,"You know , they've taken our sacred texts ."
O,They've taken our ability to make prayers in public .
O,"They've taken , you know , so much of our culture ."
O,Why ?
O,Should I let them take my happiness ?
O,"And then to two starts to laugh and giggle and say , you know , I've been through so much , but I am not going to let myself live in that place ."
O,"I mean , let myself live in that which affirms life ."
O,"And then in a kind of profound joy that we made it , that we're still alive , that we can contribute , that we can be here in this beautiful earth ."
O,And this shift of consciousness is what's needed for the world because we look honestly .
O,No amount of technology alone is going to save us .
O,"Nanotechnology and space technology and biotechnology and worldwide web , internet , computer , supercomputer technology is going to stop continuing warfare and racism and tribalism and environmental destruction ."
O,Those are happening based on consciousness of the human heart .
O,"And so we are now , you know , these we've made these enormous developments outwardly where you have the great library of Alexandria and your smartphone in your pocket along with a million , you know , cat YouTubes or whatever ."
O,But there it is .
O,It's all in there .
O,And then .
O,What we need is collectively to develop a transformation inwardly of our inner life that is parallel to this enormous outer transformation .
O,And that's that .
O,"You know , one of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff some years ago said we are a nation of nuclear giants and ethical influence ."
O,"You know , you know how well , I don't know how old humanity is , but it's time ."
O,"You know , it's time to grow up ."
O,So so that this this work that we're talking about is both individual .
O,But as you learn to meet your own life with greater understanding and compassion .
O,It empowers you to move through the world in a different way and to help others do the same .
O,"And then you get that kind of joy , too , too , in the Di Lama , that you're somehow part of an awakening that humanity now needs more than ever ."
O,"Jack , I'd love to ask you ."
O,And these interviews are always driven by some self-interest .
O,I always have some issue or challenge or problem that I'm trying to figure out .
O,So I reach out to someone like you to help me do it .
O,But I record the conversation as we chatted about before we hit record .
O,And you know this already .
O,"But the last several years have been very , very important for me in terms of addressing certain traumas in the last eight weeks in particular have been transformative in a lot of beautiful ways and the periods ."
O,The the the duration of periods within which I don't berate or attack myself have become a longer .
O,But there are still times when the wheels fly off the car .
O,And this last week has been one such example .
O,And I tend to when I make a mistake or feel like I'm backsliding or relapsing .
O,"To compound the problem by beating myself up , which then I start to ."
O,Then I beat myself up about beating myself up and you know where that goes .
O,So let me paint a picture .
O,So I found out recently that my Japanese host father and I've been in touch with this family since I was 15 .
O,"I'm very , very close to them 40 now ."
O,And I found out that he just was admitted because of the host mother sent me an email to the hospital with liver cancer .
O,And this they don't have the details yet .
O,I just sent a follow up email .
O,They don't know what the prognosis is exactly .
O,"But needless to say , the worst case scenarios are are certainly being conjoined in my mind or the potential of those ."
O,"And then simultaneously have been contending with and I believe you have some experience with this , contending with a what should be a very simple construction project of a cabin up in the mountains ."
O,And it is it has been delayed and delayed and delayed .
O,"And there have been cost overruns and cost overruns and cost overruns and promises made , promises broken , expectations set , expectations missed ."
O,And a friend of mine called with a whole new slew of problems yesterday related to this place .
O,And I lost my shit for lack of a better term .
O,"I mean , there are many other things going on simultaneously , but I got really pissed ."
O,"I was like , you know what ?"
O,This extending the olive branch being understanding can't gambit is not working with these people .
O,"Like , I need to ."
O,I need to .
O,"I need to take out the baseball bat and like pull old Tim off the shelf who is just this like juggernaut head through brick walls and be like , listen , fuckface ."
O,"Like , if you don't do ABC Disney here , well , these are gonna be the consequences ."
O,"And then I'm like , well , wait , I'm supposed to be compassionate ."
O,But how do I not be a pushover ?
O,And it turns into this big dramatic play inside my head .
O,And then I wait .
O,Then this is gonna end soon .
O,I'm not going to keep going .
O,But what I then often do is self-medicate with caffeine .
O,And I think it's a way of feeling productive without actually being productive .
O,And it also creates so much volume on the noise .
O,I think I use it to tune out a lot of feelings .
O,"So when someone relapses or has this kind of experience , what do you suggest to them ?"
O,"I mean , is there is there a particular pattern , interrupt or approach that you've found helpful for regaining footing ?"
O,So there's a number of things to say .
O,Yeah .
O,"First of all , you could call it relapsing or you just call it like , yeah , it isn't being human ."
O,"One of the poll , the most most beloved poet in Japan was a Zen master named Ryo Kahn ."
O,"And there's a two line verse that of his that I particularly find fitting for this where he wrote last year , A foolish monk this year , no change , you know ."
O,And you can sort of feel the humor and the tenderness in it .
O,"And there's a way in which you see your personality , that point , you know , you have a body , you have this particular body , your body , and you can transform it in certain ways within the limits of the body that you were given ."
O,"And similarly , you have a personality and anybody who has a number of kids realizes that you don't come in tabula rasa , that you actually this kid is born and has this kind of temperament ."
O,So you have personality .
O,"And just like you don't want to look too closely to the bar at the body , sometimes you don't look back closely , the personality either ."
O,"You know , it has its foibles and its fears and you know , all of that ."
O,"And so you start to kind of look at and say , oh , now there's a really good example of how neurotic I can get ."
O,Thank you .
O,"Thank you for reminding me , you know ."
O,"And then you get a little sort of like the keeper of the zoo , a little more tender with those kind of creatures ."
O,"So that's that's it's bringing in the non-judgment , you know , or the loving kindness for the way that you actually are and not your ideal or being compassionate ."
O,"You could say , yeah , this is a tough one ."
O,And this triggered .
O,I got triggered .
O,So what now ?
O,The other thing is that I have the same experience where we had a big remodel of our house when I was some years ago raising my daughter and and my first marriage .
O,And we were supposed to go and .
O,"Teach in travel in Europe and this guy , who is a good contractor , but , you know , everything , of course , gets more expensive when you have news and it's kept getting slowed down ."
O,I said you were going to get this done so we could make these decisions for going to Europe .
O,And it's not happening .
O,You got to hurry up .
O,I do that like three or four different times and it doesn't happen .
O,"Finally , I go in , I get pissed and I say , listen , you know , you said this in our contract ."
O,I was going to be done by .
O,And if you don't fucking get this done by the time .
O,Haul your ass in court and sue you because I need this done and I'm not gonna pay you that damn money .
O,"He looked at me and he said , Oh , you really want this done , don't you ?"
O,"I said , yes ."
O,Next day there's a huge crew .
O,It starts like this .
O,"And I realized , OK , what I've been sort of talking meditation speak ."
O,"Yeah , nice ."
O,Get it done .
O,He was a fucking contractor and I decided to .
O,I had to speak contractor ese .
O,Get the goddamn job done .
O,"Oh , your ass ."
O,"Oh , OK ."
O,I guess I got it .
O,Yeah .
O,I'll send the team over and that's all it took .
O,So there's something playful about that as well .
O,It's not that you can't .
O,I've seen the Dalai Lama get angry at people .
O,"It's not that you can't use that power and that understanding , you know , when it's necessary to get you very strong or forceful and you're not to judge yourself unless you hurt people ."
O,"And then , of course , that's the misuse of it ."
O,But it's just it's part of being human .
O,Is there something you say to yourself when .
O,No .
O,I think I don't know .
O,You are certainly in person and any with any contact I've had of you with you .
O,One of the most compassionate people I've ever met .
O,And I .
O,I don't use that word very much .
O,But your your presence of listening and being with someone is really incredible .
O,"And I don't know how much of that is an intrinsic versus trained , but for better , for worse , you coming out of the womb ."
O,I've been very impatient since day one .
O,So I worry about I can get my .
O,"It seems like my default is the yell is is speaking contractor ese to more than just the contract , the wayward contractor who's whose putting off work ."
O,Is there some when they feel that the sensations of anger beginning to bubble up ?
O,Is there something that you would suggest as self-talk or just a temporary pumping of the brakes to .
O,Make it an informed decision versus just a lashing out .
O,"Well , I could give you an answer ."
O,"But in a minute , I'm going to guide you in a little practice surface so that you can find that find the better answer ."
O,"First , I just want to say that that anger , you know , yes , it's your habit or maybe your temperament ."
O,That's energy .
O,And there's nothing wrong with energy .
O,"You know , it's it's the power to let you do all the kind of things you've done in your life that are tremendously , you know , creative or resourceful or daring or whatever kinds of things ."
O,So you want to respect .
O,"OK , I'm getting filled with energy ."
O,"And , you know , it might be and then you want to lash out ."
O,"But first , you want to respect that energy ."
O,Wow .
O,Let me feel this in my body .
O,Who ?
O,Anger .
O,How big is it ?
O,Move .
O,OK .
O,"Then your question is then your question is , what can I do to modulate it ?"
O,"I could give you , you know ."
O,"OK , take some breaths ."
O,Ground yourself .
O,Look at that other person to remember .
O,"But instead , as we're talking , let yourself picture a circumstance ."
O,"Recently , it might have been with your , you know , the contractors doing your cabin or something else ."
O,"And you're you know , that uprising of the injustice of it ."
O,And how right you are .
O,"You know , and how you're going to get this goddamn thing done , you know , and how you have to have to be hard and strong ."
O,You feel all that and feel the energy in your body .
O,First thing is just remember what it felt like .
O,"And now you're becoming kind of mindful , loving witness of it and saying , wow , this is a lot of energy ."
O,Can you feel that and remember that ?
O,"Oh , yeah , yeah ."
O,OK .
O,"Now , next step , is that the wisest , you know , figure you can imagine ?"
O,Maybe it's the mood or or maybe it's I don't know .
O,It doesn't doesn't matter .
O,"Some great master martial arts master , you know , who's mastered themselves as well as their art comes to you ."
O,And let yourself imagine somebody who's going to teach you how to manage this powerful energy and see who appears somebody peers to you .
O,Mm hmm .
O,"And first they look at you and they smile and they say , yeah ."
O,This is really this is the big energy and they appreciate you .
O,"So instead of saying , oh , you're a doofus , you know , they say , oh , yeah ."
O,You actually you actually carry some powerful energy and they acknowledge that they .
O,Bauder you .
O,Yeah .
O,And you got it .
O,All right .
O,"And then you say , yeah , but how do I manage this when it takes me over ."
O,"And so this and master whoever comes reaches under their robe and pulls out a gift for you , which is a clear symbol of exactly what you need in that moment to help you regulate it so that you can keep the energy but do it in a way that doesn't cause harm to you or another ."
O,"And this clear symbol you'll be able to see , it's just what you need ."
O,"So let yourself picture the gifts that they put in your hand and let yourself imagine , see and vision ."
O,Picture what it what it is .
O,"And if you can't see it clearly , hold it up to the sunlight ."
O,You'll be able to .
O,And then let me know what you get .
O,You mean to tell you what it is ?
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,All right .
O,"So the person who came to mind for me , I went through a few was the creator of Judo Fastenal , a guy named Jagoda oconnell really sunk ."
O,A small guy .
O,Yes .
O,Who could who could throw all the big guys and smile at the same time ?
O,Right .
O,Exactly .
O,Changed a lot .
O,Also in Japanese government .
O,Fascinating guy .
O,The .
O,The symbol .
O,"I don't know why this is , to be honest , but it's a pyramid the size with with with straight edges ."
O,The balcomb of a little too big to hold in your palm .
O,That is blue .
O,It's like a sort of almost a mixture of Scott pure sky-blue like bluebird blue with a bit of electric blue mixed in .
O,And it's sort of a smoky vapor that's floating around inside this glass pyramid .
O,"I've no idea why that's the case , but that's what came up ."
O,All right .
O,So we'll stay with it .
O,And then there's one more little piece .
O,So he gives you this .
O,This pyramid .
O,Free associate a little bit on here .
O,"What it might possibly mean , because these symbols are like dream images and they have they come from a deep place in your psyche ."
O,And this pyramid has a message for you .
O,"This blue pyramid , just guess what it might be ."
O,"I think it's very , very stable ."
O,It's extremely stable structure .
O,"And for me , it also ."
O,I could imagine it representing power .
O,"Also , it seems like a very powerful symbol in many different cultures , certainly ."
O,Yep .
O,The blue the blue is a little easier for me .
O,"It's a very cooling , soothing color where certainly red is the color red that Siiri with a fire with the right ."
O,The high resonance anger energy would be more of a red fire element .
O,So the blue would be a cooling or countering balancing force for that .
O,All right .
O,"So now what I want you to do is imagine taking this blue pyramid gift , which represents a kind of extreme stability and also a kind of power and cooling that's given to you by Jigar Okano and taking this into your body so that there you are filled with this energy and anger , you know , this huge wave ."
O,"You'd let that be there and you take this pyramid in and you let that energy be inside this stable , grounded place of power and feel what it's like to be inside this blue pyramid with this energy and feel how to feel how it affects it ."
O,Just notice as if they're you're in that circumstance .
O,And now I'm remembering I am the blue pyramid with .
O,And what do you know ?
O,What does it feel like ?
O,Life .
O,"The most noticeable thing and I wonder , of course , how much of this is the the actual visualization versus the time out ."
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,Permit myself to have .
O,But others .
O,"There's very often a tightness on the left side of my chest , right by the sternum ."
O,And I feel when I start getting wound up and that is absent when after taking this gift and then visualizing it being incorporated .
O,"So that was the way you what you're practicing , you know , and you know this very well in athletics that , yes , you practice things , but other times you also practice envisioning whether it's playing piano or whether it's , you know , some some Olympic training that some of the times you just do it through visualization and it activates a lot of the same neural circuitry that they're here ."
O,"You're starting to get the feeling of what it's like to be in the middle of this upwelling of anger and so forth , and then taking a couple of breaths and feeling the blue pyramid and the connection with the earth and the stability of it and the power then of that presence that cools you and allows the anger to be there , but not in the same uncontrolled way ."
O,"Now , there's one more thing , and that is if you imagine again , Jigar Okano , I believe you said that his name is ."
O,You got it .
O,He comes he comes up to you after giving you this gift .
O,And he touches you kindly on the shoulder .
O,"And he has a few words of advice of how to handle this powerful energy that comes up in you , because he knows all about it ."
O,And what does he whisper into your ear kindly ?
O,"Well , he whispers this this this came to mind immediately ."
O,"He says , Zen Yoko's in-your , which is , you know , I still have this actually there , too ."
O,"He has many famous quotes , but he has what you might consider proverbs , short aphorisms that I I've actually carried with me since I was 15 ."
O,But they're pack they're packed away somewhere .
O,I have two of them are on cloth .
O,"And the the first is still pretty , but still mid-table come out of the pots of its means ."
O,"Basically , if you if you work hard , you will achieve you will reach your your target ."
O,"It's not the best translation , but that's the idea ."
O,The other one is then New York was in your which is effectively the most efficient use of energy .
O,But it could also be the best slash most benevolent use of energy .
O,"And it's it's a principle of judo , but it's something that is applied to everything , including including education ."
O,"So it would be that very short bite-sized aphorism , which is and I'm sure some scholars by disagree with me , but roughly translated here , at least as I take it , is the maximum or most efficient use of energy ."
O,So take that in and take his his intentions .
O,Owens and Yoko's Enu the benevolent and efficient use of it field the pyramid .
O,And now your assignment is that the next five times that this comes with your .
O,"Well , maybe tomorrow ."
O,Or next week or so forth .
O,"Bring in the blue pyramid's stable , powerful cooling , so the energy is still there ."
O,"And then you hear his voice , Saiz and Yoko Teneo , and you go , Oh , yeah , I can use this , but I can use it in a benevolent way and try it five times and then then text me ."
O,"Let me know what happened , because now we're closing the loop ."
O,If you do it and see now you now you're responsible .
O,"If you agree that you're going to do it , it's sort of goos ."
O,It gooses the game a little bit .
O,"You go , okay , now I know I better do it because I have to let Jack know where you know what happened and let me know what happens ."
O,"Well , I'll be able now I'll be able to use this week because I'm flying out to the site of this cabin to meet with everybody and see what the hell's going on ."
O,So I'll have at least five opportunities to do .
O,Have you have your Zen training ahead ?
O,"I mean , the other thing that that's that's great ."
O,"And then that you can hear in this , rather than by giving you a cookie cutter answer , is that we actually have the wisdom that we're seeking or that's available ."
O,We have it in ourselves .
O,"I mean , you didn't have to fly to Kyoto and get in your time machine to go back and say you got , oh , oh , you know , or whoever it happens to be the Dalai Lama or whoever happens to come to you , the Buddha or or some other great figure that actually the goddess of compassion that we carry , that wisdom in our own heart ."
O,And part of what these contemplative trainings do is they give us access just by taking a little mental pause .
O,It didn't take you thirty seconds .
O,"OK , he appears ."
O,What do I do ?
O,Here's how my body would feel .
O,What what perspective should I bring here is efficient and benevolent use of energy .
O,"OK , now I remember ."
O,So these answers for the for the questions of the psyche in the heart don't require .
O,"Going somewhere , they ask us to quiet and begin to listen ."
O,"And as you do , then you discover your own and your own inherent wisdom and your own compassion as well , because the benevolent use that he offers to you ."
O,Where does that live ?
O,It lives in Tim .
O,It lives in you .
O,"It's one of the one of the reasons I've I've wanted to have you on the podcast for so long is that for me , you represent a very wide spectrum of tools ."
O,"You have developed a tool kit that has enabled you to work with everyone from the seekers of , say , the Buddhist ."
O,"Along the lines of the Buddhist traditions to say adolescent's or cutters to war vets with PTSD , missing limbs and so on ."
O,"You've worked with a very diverse set of students and patients , maybe even in that leads me to my next question , which is after these experiences abroad , why did you decide to pursue to come back ?"
O,Why do you decide to come back to the US period ?
O,And then why did you decide to go back to school and study clinical psychology ?
O,"So after the first five years in Asia , there were certain there were few other Westerners who would become Hmong ."
O,So it was a handful and some were going to stay for the rest of their lives .
O,I learned a lot .
O,And so that was kind of a choice .
O,Am I just going to stay ?
O,"And I realized , no , I want a family ."
O,I want a lover .
O,"You know , I was a young man after all , and just the celibacy for those years was actually pretty hard ."
O,I want .
O,I want to see if what I have learned really translates into the life back home .
O,I don't want to just leave it .
O,"And so I was I'm wrestling , but it became very clear to me that that I wasn't fit for the monastery for the rest of my life ."
O,"I had other loverly other desires , but also and longings , but also a real interest to say , does this work elsewhere ?"
O,"So I came back and that , well , what can I do ?"
O,I got a got a couple jobs and right away .
O,"And of course , what I knew how to do as a student , but I was now a student of the mind and the heart ."
O,"And I thought , well , how do I learn more about what happened to me in the monastery ?"
O,"Oh , I'll study Western psychology ."
O,And so that started me on that particular path .
O,And I learned a lot of complementary things .
O,There's some very good trauma work in the West that I've learned about that really enhances the compassion and loving kindness and mindfulness things that I learned in in the temple .
O,"And , you know , now I've done a lot of years of teaching eastern Western psychology together ."
O,These principles that I've learned are spreading so widely in Western psychology .
O,I went to the largest therapy conference in in the country in December and down in Anaheim .
O,"And David talking , no , here is a room full of 3000 or 5000 people ."
O,And I ask how many of you have some experience of meditation or mindfulness practice ?
O,"And the majority of the hands went up and that would not have happened , you know , 20 or 30 years ago ."
O,So the eastern psychology is now becoming more invisibly woven into the understandings of clinical psychology in the West .
O,It's beautiful .
O,"Now , I want to say something else ."
O,"You know , when you talk about working with a variety of population , you know ."
O,So .
O,Yes .
O,People in prisons .
O,Yes .
O,"That's kids coming out of gangs , but also CEOs ."
O,And there's a dialogue that Bill Ford and I did .
O,"He was that that time the chairman of Ford Motors , he was actually the CEO perhaps before that ."
O,And as he's the chairman of Ford Motors .
O,"And he talks about it , too ."
O,"It was in 2008 , I guess , when the auto industry was just about to melt down ."
O,And he called .
O,We had some contact .
O,He's a meditator .
O,"And he said , you know , I'm going to lose the my grandfather's company and maybe the whole industry on my watch ."
O,And it's hard to sleep .
O,What can I do ?
O,And we did lovingkindness practices and and mindfulness practices together and so forth .
O,And I gave him some practices that he could use .
O,And it turns out that .
O,"Whatever level you're on , whether you're incarcerated or whether you're a CEO or whether you're a returning vet , that these inner capacities that we have to be present without getting lost to bring an understanding attention to these energies ."
O,"Just as you were doing with anger in ourselves are really , really liberating ."
O,And sometimes you know what's needed like for the vets or that the people coming back from the war is also a kind of forgiveness practice in trauma work .
O,"We'll come together and , you know , they'll say things like , I can't tell you what I saw because in fact , people don't want to hear the horrors of war ."
O,They can't tell the story .
O,"And if they do , often they retraumatize themselves and the people around them couldn't bear it ."
O,"But there is something worse because they'll say , I can't tell you what I had to do ."
O,"And so it's locked up in their hearts , you know ?"
O,And then what do they have ?
O,"They can drink or they can , you know , distract themselves or or get in , you know , blind rage periodically ."
O,"But if you get a room of returning combat vets and hold it with a proper space of understanding and compassion , not only can they tell their stories , which they've never told , but they can listen to one another and say , oh , yeah , I've been there and all of a sudden they're not so alone anymore ."
O,And that release the weight on their heart .
O,So there's a social dimension to trauma where we need to tell the story helps them release also what's carried in their nervous system and in their body .
O,And there's some some correlation between between those two together that becomes very powerful .
O,And we need that .
O,"We need I do a lot of teaching of forgiveness , practice and self forgiveness ."
O,Those are also on those those guided meditations that I teach .
O,"And for a lot of us , self forgiveness like self compassion becomes a very , very important way to liberate ourselves from what we had to do to survive in the past so that we're actually free in our life ."
O,"How do you set the stage , for instance , with those with those vets ?"
O,Do you say to them or what would exercise ?
O,Might you do that ?
O,okso outdoor for them to hear these stories .
O,"So a couple of images , one with gang kids and then one with that's for four gang kids who come in or these kids who are trying to get out of gangs and might come with a mentor or something like that ."
O,"To some events we've had and these guys in their you know , their their hoods are up and their hats are on backward and they're leaning back and saying , come on , man , you're going to teach us meditation ."
O,You're going to teach us .
O,Give us some poem stories or bit .
O,We're out on the street .
O,People got .
O,Mm .
O,"You know , you got to give us something better than that ."
O,So we try to make a .
O,Setting that honor is who they are .
O,"From the very beginning , you say , well , we can't talk yet about the real things that we came here to do because there are too many people in this room who have not been acknowledged and not been respected ."
O,"So would you go out in the parking lot and pick up a stone for every young person , you know , who's been killed and we light one candle and put it in the center of a table ."
O,"Say , bring it back in and say their name and put their stone by this candle ."
O,The simplest possible ritual .
O,And these guys and sometimes gals will come in and their hands are full of stones .
O,"No young people should know that many dead people and they'll say , this is for teto and this is for RJ ."
O,And this is for homegirl .
O,And pretty soon there's a mound of stones and the names of people they've lost will were put into the the fabric of the air of that room .
O,And their hoods are no longer over their heads .
O,"They're sitting up like , OK , this is a place where we can talk about what's really going on ."
O,So there's something about making whether it's through as simple as ritual or making a container in which people realize that this is a safe place to talk about what we've never done before with the vets .
O,"One of the things that Michael Mead , Luis Rodriguez , these guys from Mosaic Multicultural Foundation that I've worked with for years and are really wonderful , Michael , who is a you know , a great drummer and a storyteller and Mythologised , who has also been working in prisons and with vets and gang kids for years ."
O,"He'll say , let me tell you an ancient story of returning warriors ."
O,"And he has a handful of stories from Africa or Tibet or the Mayan tradition about warriors coming back , you know , with their hands covered with blood ."
O,"And , you know , their eyes filled with the the Mars with the martial energy that they would that they can't stop the violence because it's taken them over ."
O,And here's a myth or a story that tells about how ancient warriors were brought back into their community .
O,I'll tell you that myth if you want to hear one of them .
O,"Oh , yes , please ."
O,So here we are .
O,"You know , and there's these there's these vets ."
O,And already stories have started to pour out about .
O,I can't tell you .
O,I saw I can't tell you what I had to do .
O,"And Michael stood up and he said , let me tell you an old Irish story of an Irish warrior name , Koku Lane ."
O,"I'm not sure how his name is put out , something like that ."
O,Then he was the most fierce and famous of all Irish warriors .
O,"And the Irish warriors were were Mad Men because they would go out , they paint their bodies and they'd go out naked ."
O,And sometimes you just see them coming and you'd run the other way .
O,"But anyway , there was some marauding king , king , king , an army that had come to threaten their area ."
O,And so Cuckoo Lane went out and almost single handedly chased them and defeated them .
O,"But then he was coming back to his own town in a chariot covered with blood and his eyes blazing , bearing down on his own town , still possessed with the violence of war with the God Mars ."
O,"And they were all terrified he would come and do violence there , too ."
O,And so they ran .
O,What can we do ?
O,What can we do ?
O,"And they went to ask the old wise woman in the village , and she said three things ."
O,"And so the first thing , they lined up all the women in the village who bared their breasts , and this slowed him down as if it reminded him of his mother's milk or something ."
O,"And because he was slowed down , then the second thing they did was take a rope and tie it around him and put him in a huge cauldron of cold water which hissed off his body ."
O,And then they filled it three times with cold water and finally his body cooled down .
O,And then the third thing they did is they took him and still bound and they lay him on a carpet in the court of the local king .
O,And they sang to him the stories and myths and songs of warriors who had protected the kingdom and then come back and released the violence and the fears that they carried and planted their crops again and loved their families and resumed living in harmony with the community from which they came .
O,And they told the ancient stories and sang the songs for three days and nights .
O,"And when it was over , a cuckoo curling eyes open ."
O,"That is , they untied him and he was back as a normal human being again ."
O,"And after Michael told this story to that , who'd been telling terrible accounts of things that happened in this room ?"
O,"One hundred men stood up and we'd been working with a simple African chant , a song that was really an African chant of a prayer , you know ?"
O,"Earth , hold me for this ."
O,Living is hard .
O,"We all sang to the vets together for a long time , as if we couldn't sing them back into their bodies from this , as if they were alive ."
O,Lying there in the court and the king .
O,"So this is a new ask the question , how do you how do you make a setting that allows people to truly feel that they can tell their stories and be held in compassion , whether it's the grief of these gang kids that no one's really given them the place to give voice to , you know , or that who says , I can't tell you what I had to do ?"
O,That's very powerful .
O,"And it makes me also think back to conversations I've had with Sebastian Junger , who is a wartime journalist , as is as co-produced and shot a number of really hammering documentary films including Restrepo and most recently wrote a book called Tribe that touches on some similar topic area and leads me to ask you , are there any rites of passages or rituals that you feel would be useful for every man or woman to experience , speak for ?"
O,And this is something that I've felt a longing for and a lack of since my teenage years .
O,I .
O,I'm not Jewish .
O,Did not have a bat mitzvah bar mitzvah .
O,"I don't know if that serves that purpose in the in the Jewish tradition , necessarily ."
O,"But are there any any rituals or rites of passage that you think we could use in , let's just say , the United States ?"
O,That would be helpful .
O,To whether it's a specific population specific group or .
O,Do you know anyone so why you're talking about as a really big subject ?
O,"It's the subject of initiation and unfortunately , bar mitzvahs , at least when I was ."
O,Whereas it was a relatively lightweight and meaningless thing .
O,"You get up there and you recite your , you know , Hebrew portion of the Bible and now you're a man and they give you a bunch of presents ."
O,And there wasn't a lot of meaning in it .
O,But the the problem that you raise is that the lack of initiation and what's true is that it's been forgotten in our culture .
O,One of the few places you get initiation is going into the military .
O,"That's right , initiation ."
O,"But a lot of these gang kids , for example , they're trying to initiate themselves , which can't really happen ."
O,You need elders and you needed in a ritualized way .
O,But don't go on that .
O,"You know , if you're in the Maasai tradition in East Africa and the Maasai people , as everybody's heard , you know , a young man at a certain age of 14 or something ."
O,We'll go out and kill a lion to prove that they're now an adult member of the society and that they're brave .
O,And that's part of their initiation .
O,There were initiations for young women as well .
O,And it's not just in Africa .
O,The Mayans had initiations .
O,"And in Thailand , when I lived , they are back starting in the 1960s ."
O,"At that point , almost every young man and many young women , when they reached the age of 19 , 20 , they became a monk for three months or for a year and lived in an austere way ."
O,And it was part of their initiation to learn both the inner life of themselves and also a kind of discipline .
O,We don't have it .
O,"And because of it , you know , kids are trying to initiate themselves on the streets by , you know , shooting somebody or doing something , you know , that shows that they're brave ."
O,"But it's not a lion , it's another person or it's , you know , trying to get the attention of the others and say prove how how powerful or strong they are ."
O,"So we desperately need these and we need them built into our education , into our psychology ."
O,"And I can't give you a simple answer , but one of the people who has the most intelligence about this is a man , a colleague of mine named Michael Mede ."
O,"And if you look at Mosaic Multicultural Foundation , his writings on initiation and what's possible here and the things he's led are very , very inspiring ."
O,So that's a place that I wouldn't look .
O,That's a good starting point .
O,Wonderful .
O,I will certainly find that .
O,"Well , Jack , I think we could go for hours and hours and hours ."
O,And I always love chatting with you and I'd love to perhaps even consider doing a part to some time .
O,"But given that we've already gone for two plus hours , I want to ask just a a few more questions ."
O,"And I'll actually start with just reading something very short , which is from your 2017 year end message ."
O,"And this I think this is just to inject some more optimism into our conversation , which we've already had plenty of ."
O,But this is this is just a small portion of your year in message .
O,Martin Luther King Junior describes our collective journey with hope .
O,"Quote , The arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice , end quote ."
O,And Pablo Neruda explains further .
O,"You can cut all the flowers , but you cannot keep spring from coming ."
O,Renewal is happening .
O,This is back to your voice .
O,Take quiet time to listen to your heart .
O,To meditate and to rest amidst the great turnings .
O,Feel the renewal of spring that can be born in you .
O,Align yourself with goodness .
O,"Let yourself blossom like a lotus , or whatever unique flower you are shining in the world , offering tiny seeds of love amidst it all ."
O,Blessings to you in 2018 .
O,Jack and I want this .
O,This note to then lead into and certainly welcome to come in on that .
O,But which book you would recommend of yours ?
O,"People start with or where they start with all of the many materials , recordings , readings that you produced because you re a fantastic writer and a prolific writer ."
O,"You've some of my favorite book titles I've ever heard , by the way , including After The Ecstasy , The Laundry , which maybe we could touch on ."
O,But where would you suggest people start ?
O,"Of the many things that you've that you've written and shared with the world , and if you've any comments on that , you're in message ."
O,You're welcome to share that as well .
O,"So for books , if you want something simple , I have books like , you know , an introduction to meditation that sounds to publishers or I have a little book called The Art of Forgiveness Loving Kindness and Peace , which is very simple stories and practices ."
O,If you want something that's richer and fuller than you could look at one of my bigger books like A Path With Heart or the Wise Heart The Guide to the Two Principles of Buddhist Psychology .
O,"And again , I think lots of stuff online and sounds strus particularly a good place to go along with my Web site ."
O,"Then add that 40 day mindfulness mindfulness daily , which is like it's like 30 bucks or something ."
O,"And you know , is a really wonderful way to start in terms of what I had written about the trusting heart ."
O,One of the greatest Zen texts from a thousand years ago says to be awakened or enlightened is one with the trusting heart and mind .
O,And that doesn't mean that that we won't go through hard times .
O,We always have and we will again .
O,"And we are now in many ways , but that we also have born within us the capacity to meet these difficulties with understanding and with courage , with compassion and to transform them ."
O,"And in that way , one of my favorite recent books is called The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker ."
O,"And he's a remarkable professor at Harvard , anthropologist , historian , talking about the growing consciousness of humanity in spite of the kind of wars and conflict and environmental things ."
O,"There are so many good things that have happened that he charts over the last few centuries of the development of , you know , certain certain abilities for peacemaking ."
O,"There's actually less war than there'd been no respect for for women , the reduction in , you know , child labor , all kinds of things ."
O,"And in that same regard , there's a wonderful book called Bury the Chains , which is about the ending of slavery in the British Empire , starting with this handful of men who met in a British tea shop or a printing shop and spent 30 years riding around the country , bringing ex slaves who were well-spoken to talk about the Middle Passage and the , you know , the horrors of slavery and so forth ."
O,"And even though the British empire's economic engine was built around slavery and sugar by the end of their work of 30 years , the British parliament outlined slavery and the British Empire , as you know , decades before it happened in the US ."
O,And the Quakers were a big part of this .
O,And the Quakers famously wouldn't take their hats off for the king .
O,But when what is his name ?
O,"Thomas Clarkson , who is the center of this group trying to end slavery and going everywhere to do it ?"
O,When Thomas Clarkson died that all the Quakers of the England England took their hats off because he'd he's freed so many spirits and so many lives .
O,"So the possum , we have these amazing possibilities as human beings and we're just growing into them now culturally ."
O,"And it's about time , but it's it ."
O,But they are possible .
O,And we each have a have a contribution to make .
O,"Jack , me ask you one more question before we wrap up with just letting people know where they can find you on social media and elsewhere on the Web site and so on ."
O,But last question is when I'd like to ask and this is this is metaphore .
O,But if you could have a short message on a billboard .
O,"In other words , get him get a message out to millions or billions of people ."
O,"Could be a few words , one word , phrase , quote of yours , a quote of someone else's ."
O,What might you put on that billboard ?
O,"Well , two things come to mind ."
O,"One is a question that when I sit with sat with people many times at the end of their life , that they that they then ask of themselves silently or outloud is did I love well ?"
O,"Because in the end , what matters really , the billboard would have a question rather than a statement ."
O,"And it would have a question , something like ."
O,I don't know how could I love myself better or what ?
O,"You know , so that it actually it's not that I'm going to tell them something ."
O,"They already know this , but I'm going to remind those who read that there is something that's asking to be awakened in them ."
O,How could I love myself and this world better ?
O,"And then , you know , or what gets you know , and then you go , well , it gets in the way of that ."
O,"And how can I love that , too ?"
O,How could I love myself in this world better ?
O,"Well , Jack , I want to , of course , thank you for your time today ."
O,"But beyond that , I want to thank you ."
O,"And this is this is very , very much from deep in my heart ."
O,"Thank you for helping me to learn to love myself better and quite frankly , to see something ."
O,In the first place that is worth loving .
O,"That's not where I've spent most of my life , so it's it's turned into if not my ."
O,"I hesitate to say my top priority because I'm worried about sounding self-indulgent , but it's become one of the most important and fruitful ."
O,Tasks in my life is asking that question how could I love myself better or how could I learn to love myself better ?
O,"So thank you very , very sincerely for that ."
O,"And the words don't do it justice , but that's all ."
O,That's the best I can do right now remotely is to is to put it into words .
O,So thank you for that .
O,"Thank you , Tim ."
O,This was this was a pleasure to do .
O,And what I feel and I know is it is you tend your own heart .
O,In a wise way .
O,"Then it makes you available to bring the gifts , the many gifts you have to the world , you personally and others ."
O,But to do it in a way that's on the carrier wave of connection and love and it transforms everything .
O,So thank you to .
O,"Well , Jack ."
O,"I know I'm looking at a text third of ours and I'm feeling the necklace around my neck , which is really a thread , a red for that was used to close the one of the elements of the closing of the 10 day silent retreat ."
O,And I shot you a text not too long ago asking what the three knots meant because I had forgotten .
O,And this is what you wrote back .
O,First not equals refuge in whatever you hold is most inspiring and sacred .
O,"Second , commitment to compassion for self and others ."
O,"Third , following your highest intention and the intention that I've set at the end of the ten day retreat was to learn to love myself so I could love others more fully ."

B-AD,This episode is brought to you by four stigmatic .
I-AD,"You might remember Fort Semetic for their mushroom coffee , which was created by those clever Finnish founders ."
I-AD,"And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast , the product sold out in less than a week , lights you up like a Christmas tree , which can be really useful ."
I-AD,"However , recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum a new product and that is their ratib mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep ."
I-AD,"As you guys may know , longtime listeners at least I struggled with insomnia for decades ."
I-AD,"Have a largely fixed that , but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy ."
I-AD,"Still isn't easy very often and I found a ratio which I've been fascinated by for a few years now has been very , very effective in performing their old formula ."
I-AD,"However , for somatics , old formula included stevia , and I like to avoid sweeteners , all sweeteners for a host of reasons ."
I-AD,"And I then just ping them and asked , Hey guys , I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested , but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it ."
I-AD,Too much of a headache .
I-AD,Don't worry .
I-AD,And they are always game for experimentation .
I-AD,"And so they created a special custom version without the stevia , without sweeteners ."
I-AD,Now it is part of my nightly routine .
I-AD,Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets which are perfect for travel .
I-AD,"And in fact , I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my carry-on bag ."
I-AD,"You only need hot water and it mixes very , very easily ."
I-AD,"Here , here's some recommended copy that they put in the read ."
I-AD,So I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take .
I-AD,"Quote , a warning for those in the experimental mindset , Ricci is strong and bitter in parentheses , like any great medicine ."
I-AD,"So if the bitterness is too much , I recommend trying it with honey and or nut milk , such as almond milk , end quote ."
I-AD,"So I'm going to say , no , you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter ."
I-AD,"And maybe you should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing youngins , when they say Wolong should cool ."
I-AD,Which means you're not able to eat bitterness .
I-AD,"Bitter is in many cases indication of things that help libber , detoxification and so on ."
I-AD,"Not saying that's the case here , but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members , on friends ."
I-AD,Everybody has liked it .
I-AD,It's a little bitter .
I-AD,It's not that hard .
I-AD,"So I would just say suck it up and no , don't put in honey or not milk or any of that shit ."
I-AD,Just drink the goddamn tea .
I-AD,It's delicious .
I-AD,"I think if you like to air that kind of stuff , that type of tea , you're gonna dig it ."
I-AD,So just try it .
I-AD,Okay .
I-AD,Back to then my read if you'd like to naturally improve your sleep both onset and quality .
I-AD,I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio lecture without any sweeteners .
I-AD,It has organic racey extract .
I-AD,Organic fueled mint extract .
I-AD,Organic rose hips extract .
I-AD,Organic tulsi extract .
