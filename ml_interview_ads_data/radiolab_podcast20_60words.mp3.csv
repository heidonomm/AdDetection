O,It's jammed so with the events of the last couple of days .
O,"By that I mean , of course , the administration's decision to order a drone strike that killed Iranian general Kassams Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport , which has unleashed a chain of events that leads ."
O,We have no idea where with that happening .
O,"We wanted to play an episode , which I think really puts this situation in a much larger context ."
O,"We first broadcast this in April of 2014 , him to play it for you as we originally put it out ."
O,"And then on the back end , we'll talk a little bit about how this all relates to the current situation that's unfolding ."
O,"Again , this was originally broadcast in 2014 , but it seems to really speak to what's happening right now ."
O,You're .
O,You're listening to Radiolab Radio from WNYC .
O,"Oh , yeah , ready ?"
O,"Hey , I'm Jad Abumrad ."
O,I'm Robert KRULWICH and this is Radiolab .
O,"Today , we've got a story about the crazy power of words , in particular , 60 words , single sentence ."
O,"That is what has , you could say , defined America for the last 12 years ."
O,"And yeah , the place to start is a difficult one ."
O,"This just in , you were looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there , September 11th , 2001 , 8:46 a.m. that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center ."
O,We don't know anything more than that .
O,We don't know if this is a day that anyone who is old enough to remember does remember .
O,We have no way you can remember where we were and who we were with .
O,So you have no idea when another plane just hit .
O,"Oh , my God ."
O,Another plane has just hit .
O,"And of course , we can remember how he felt ."
O,"Oh , look , it is the worst attack ever on American soil ."
O,"But if you really want to understand the world we live in now , you've got to jump ahead one day to September 12th to a corner office in the White House , where there's a lawyer sitting at a computer trying to figure out how are we going to declare war ?"
O,"And one of the things that everybody realizes after sort of an initial discussion is , yes , we'd like to declare war ."
O,But we have no idea upon whom we should declare war .
O,"That is Gregory Johnsen , the Michael Hastings National Security Reporting Fellow at BuzzFeed ."
O,"Now , the reason this lawyer man by the name of Timothy Flanigan ."
O,The reason Flanagan is sitting at a computer in an office is because then President George Bush had to do something .
O,"He had to act , and he didn't want to act alone ."
O,He wanted congressional approval .
O,Right .
O,"I mean , technically in an emergency , the president can defend the country ."
O,"He is the commander in chief , after all ."
O,"He doesn't have to go to Congress and say , hey , do I have authorization to use force ?"
O,"Not an emergency that's been witnessed , by the way , senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution ."
O,But President Bush needed Congress on his side .
O,"He felt it was important that we project unity , that we were all standing together as one ."
O,"And second , if this was an act of war , the power to declare war in the Constitution is given to Congress , not to the executive ."
O,"And when Congress declares war , suddenly the president has a very clear and powerful man ."
O,"Now , the declaration of war is kind of a dead instrument of international law ."
O,"I mean , nobody's declared war since World War Two , but the modern incarnation of the declaration of war is the authorization to use force ."
O,"The authorization to use force , what's called the authorization for the use of military force , or as it's commonly referred to , the a.u M-F ."
O,Right .
O,"So our lawyer in the White House , Flanigan , he's given a task go right in AMF that Congress consent of the president ."
O,He really has no idea .
O,"So he goes back to the last time that the U.S. did this , last time Congress passed one of these things ."
O,He does a quick sort of search on his computer .
O,Boom finds it .
O,"1991 , Iraq , the Gulf War ."
O,Flannagan grabs the text .
O,And then he copies that into a word document .
O,And that becomes his template .
O,"He makes some cuts , he makes some changes ."
O,He delete some words .
O,And then .
O,"He had sent her war on terror a just war , and he sets in motion this bewildering series of events ."
O,A U.S. drone strike is linked to al-Qaida and the Chinese .
O,"Hey , it's madness ."
O,That is basically the world we live in .
O,Fifteen members of a wedding procession were killed .
O,"And if you're like me , bizarre , even sadistic treatment ."
O,"You like me and you find yourself flipping through the channels , see the news , basically ignoring it ."
O,"Then every so often thinking , wait a second ."
O,Terrorism targets in Africa from Libya .
O,"Now the U.S. Air Force , a drone strike in southern Somalia ."
O,We wait .
O,How are we doing this in all these different places ?
O,One hundred prisoners are on a hunger strike .
O,And like that in protest of their indefinite detention .
O,How how are we detaining people for so long ?
O,Is that is it okay to do that ?
O,"Well , just who signed off on this ?"
O,You know .
O,And it turns out we all did because it was in that document .
O,"This is the legal foundation for everything that the U.S. has done , everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes to secret renditions , to seal raids ."
O,It's all been hung off these 60 words .
O,And that's the crazy part .
O,"The body of this document , the part that really matters ."
O,"And the reason that when I was reading Gregory's reporting on this , I was like , what is it ?"
O,"It all goes back to one single sentence , 60 words , one sentence ."
O,Can you read it ?
O,Absolutely .
O,"That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations , organizations or persons ."
O,60 words .
O,"Today , a collaboration with BuzzFeed and with reporter Gregory Johnsen ."
O,We're going to try to decode those words and ask where did those words come from ?
O,"And how could they come to mean what they mean just now , what you think they know ?"
O,And how did they end up leading us into what is arguably the longest war in American history ?
O,And nobody saw it coming ?
O,Absolutely no .
O,But that's the weirdest part .
O,Well .
O,Nobody minus one .
O,Let's start there .
O,Maybe you should introduce us to Barbara Lee .
O,Right .
O,"Barbara Lee is a congresswoman from right around Berkeley , California ."
O,Hello .
O,Hello .
O,Hello .
O,"Hi , it's Barbara ."
O,And she is someone who has been in many ways a lifelong activist going all the way back to when she was 15 in high school in San Fernando Valley because I wanted to be a cheerleader .
O,"But , you know , since this was the early 60s , you had to have certain criteria like at least whether it was stated or not , blond and blue eyed ."
O,I would have been hard for you .
O,I would figure that was really hard .
O,So I went to the NAACP .
O,She got them to pressure the school to change the rules .
O,And I won .
O,And she became the first black cheerleader at her high school .
O,Yeah .
O,Yeah .
O,That's just by way of introduction .
O,Fast forward many years .
O,She becomes a congresswoman .
O,She gets elected to a second term .
O,"And on that day , there is smoke pouring out of the Pentagon ."
O,She was at the Capitol .
O,No one knew where to go .
O,"So the police officers just said , run , run , run ."
O,"Go , go , go ."
O,This was an apparent terrorist attack on our country .
O,"So I ran out of the Capitol , down Pennsylvania Avenue ."
O,"I remember looking back and saw a lot of smoke , which was , you know , the Pentagon , you know , clearly the country is under attack ."
O,"Clearly , people have died ."
O,"Clearly , we've got to deal with whoever did this , whatever it takes ."
O,"Fast forward two days , September 13th , Barley's back at the capital to meet with her Democratic colleagues to review that document that Flanigan had sent over , the mood in the room was very somber and very angry ."
O,The thing we have to keep in mind when we're talking about this is all of this was done within 72 hours after the worst terrorist attack in United States history and very confused .
O,What would be the appropriate response ?
O,"So as she and her colleagues read those 60 words , there was a lot of debate going on back and forth ."
O,"Oh , yes ."
O,"Oh , yes , from everyone , because this actually wasn't the first draft Flanagan had sent one over the night before September 12 , 2001 , and that one was something that almost no one agreed to ."
O,"To Gregory , that early draft had a few extra lines in it ."
O,One gave the president the power to preempt any future acts of aggression against the United States .
O,"And Barbara Lee and her colleagues knew that , look , so many things can be packed into this word aggression that if we sign on to this , that if we give the president this power , the president may never have to come back to Congress ever again and request authorization for military force , because he can say that anything is aggression ."
O,And we're also giving him the power to preempt .
O,So they kicked it back to the White House .
O,Flanigan took out those words .
O,"And now they had this new draft that the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force , which is what you heard ."
O,"It's still when Barbara read that and saw phrases like all necessary and appropriate force , she thought , what does that even mean ?"
O,"I said , this is too broad , was not definitive ."
O,It's open ended .
O,"And as she was speaking , this is taking place in the basement of the Capitol building ."
O,She sees some of her Democratic colleagues start to nod .
O,Yep .
O,People were nodding .
O,People were nodding because everybody there knew the danger of ill-defined words .
O,"You just had to go back 50 years to the Gulf of Tonkin , Gulf of Tonkin , Tonkin , Tonkin , Tonkin with an N yes to explain to my fellow American commander in chief ."
O,"1964 , LBJ announces that two American ships , U.S. destroyers parked in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam , were torpedoed by North Vietnamese boats by a number of hostile vessels ."
O,Many people now argue that one of these attacks never even happened .
O,"Nonetheless , President Johnson wants to strike back ."
O,"So he ask Congress to pass a resolution which they did , giving him the power to , quote , take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression ."
O,Making it clear that our government is united in its determination to take all necessary measures and support our freedom and in defense of peace in Southeast Asia .
O,"Now , it is the broad language of that document ."
O,Most people believe that open the door to the worst part of the Vietnam War .
O,"The Rangers , the Marines took casualties mostly from hidden snipers ."
O,The thousands and thousands of casualties just keep dropping .
O,Nothing you can do .
O,Horrific atrocities .
O,Charges have been made that troops killed as many as five hundred sixty seven South Vietnamese civilians during a sweep in March 1968 .
O,"And in a television interview in 1969 , when President Johnson was asked to justify it all , he said , you can't just blame him ."
O,Congress gave us this authority in August 1964 .
O,Maybe not sure .
O,That's pretty far reaching .
O,That's the sky's the limit .
O,"So the lessons of the Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam , that was very much in the air in that meeting on September 13th , 2001 ."
O,Several key leaders hoped to avoid a repeat of the 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution .
O,So it understandable that when Barbara Lee stood up and said to her colleagues she was worried about some of this language .
O,People were nodding .
O,People were nodding .
O,So there was a lot of uncertainty about what to do .
O,"But in the end , those concerns were ultimately outweighed by another desire ."
O,We've got to be unified with the president .
O,We can't show political divisions .
O,Let's have the nation .
O,Let's have Congress speaking with one voice .
O,It was a time for unity and for action .
O,"And so walking out of that Democratic caucus meeting on the evening of September 13th , congressional leadership decided that these 60 words , this is the version ."
O,There's no going back to the drawing board .
O,"And so that 10:16 a.m. September 14 , 2001 , said Senate will come to order ."
O,The Senate is gaveled into session .
O,Work will call the roll .
O,Daschle calls a vote .
O,"Mr. Akaka , Mr. Allard , Mr. Allen , there are 98 senators on the floor ."
O,"Mr. Durbin , Mr. Voinovich ."
O,All 98 of them vote .
O,Yay !
O,No senator voted in the negative .
O,So was a sweep .
O,Yeah .
O,"Later in the day , the resolution would go to the House where Barbara Lee was a representative ."
O,Dashiell had actually rushed the vote through the Senate because the White House has called for a national prayer meeting at the National Cathedral for the victims of 9/11 .
O,That's supposed to start right at noon .
O,"And so right after the vote , all the senators pour out of the Capitol and get onto the buses trying to get through the drizzle ."
O,It was actually raining that day .
O,"Now , at that moment , Barbara Lee ."
O,She hadn't decided how it is that she was going to vote .
O,"I struggled with it for the previous two nights , September 12th and 13th ."
O,"She'd stayed up late calling back to advisers , to friends in California ."
O,"We talked every day , including this guy ."
O,This is Ron Dellums .
O,I serve for over 27 years in the U.S. House of Representatives .
O,Barbara used to be his chief of staff .
O,"And when he resigned , she won his congressional seat ."
O,"You know , she would say , well , what about this and what do you think about that ?"
O,"And we kind of talked through the the emotional state of the country that we are feeling pain , anger ."
O,We're shocked .
O,Both Barbara and Ron were trained as psychiatric social workers .
O,"So they both knew that when a person is feeling all of those things , it's generally better to do nothing ."
O,"Yes , psychology one to one ."
O,You don't make decisions when you're mourning afraid .
O,"On the other hand , I believe , you know , in unity , too ."
O,I want to be unified with the president when the country is under attack .
O,"I understood he didn't tell me eat and say which way I should vote , but I did say to her ."
O,"Barbara , how ever you vote ."
O,I will always respect you .
O,You will always be friend .
O,You will always be family .
O,"So at that moment , with the memorial service about to start in a few hours till the House vote ."
O,Barbara Lee was at the Capitol .
O,I was in the cloak room .
O,"And since she wasn't sure how she was going to vote , she planned to skip the memorial service ."
O,She wanted to stay .
O,She wanted to think .
O,And then I don't know what it was .
O,May have been the spirit .
O,Move me .
O,I don't know .
O,"But at the very last minute , she was drinking actually cans of ginger ale at the time ."
O,So I think I'm going to go and I just ran out .
O,I probably was the last one on the bus .
O,I had the Kanna ginger ale in my hand and ran down the steps and got on the bus .
O,"She got to the cathedral , the house buses arrived about 30 minutes or so before the opening ."
O,"And so for for 30 minutes , she's in the cathedral about halfway back ."
O,Listening to the Oregon .
O,Thinking about the families in those who were killed .
O,"There are people around here who are sort of whispering the pain and anguish , the few people who are crying ."
O,"Well , I said I got to pray over this ."
O,And she's just wrestling with her vote .
O,Her heart is saying one thing .
O,This is too broad and her head is saying unity .
O,How is it that you can be against the president at this point ?
O,"Speaking of the president , eventually President Bush takes the podium ."
O,We are here in the middle hour of our grief .
O,"Just three days removed from these events , Americans do not yet have the distance of history ."
O,But our responsibility to history is already clear .
O,To answer these attacks and rid the world of evil .
O,"And then as soon as President Bush steps down , everyone in the congregation stands up ."
O,And they they sing The Battle Hymn of the Republic .
O,"Which is a very powerful , a very moving piece of music , but it's not the sort of thing that is typically sung at a memorial service ."
O,It's a very forward and almost aggressive sounding as the phrase terrible swift sword .
O,Yeah .
O,"My God , it was not quite what I expected in a memorial service , but the second speaker , a reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter , got up and he gave a reading from Jeremiah , 31 , when ancient Israel suffered the excruciating pain and tragedy of militant aggression and destruction ."
O,Hearing that all over again takes me right back there .
O,"And I remember a voice is heard in Raimo lamenting and bitter , weeping at her , weeping Rachel , weeping for her children , weeping for her children ."
O,"When he spoke , that's when to me it was the memorial ."
O,And then .
O,"He he started to pray for the healing of our grief stricken hearts , for the souls on sacred memory of those who have been lost ."
O,And he said something that really struck Barbara Lee .
O,Let us also pray for divine wisdom .
O,"He said , as we act , as we act , we do not become the evil we deplore ."
O,That evil that we deplore .
O,"When he said that , I became very ."
O,It was this sense of peace and calm came over me .
O,And Barbara Lee says it was right then that she knew it .
O,She'd do the Kirkham report .
O,The title House Joint Resolution 64 Joint Resolution to authorize the use of United States ARM .
O,"Later that evening , the House opens up its debate on the EU IMF ."
O,"Speaker I rise in support of this resolution , which authorizes the president to use all force necessary in Congress person after congressperson ."
O,Mr. Speaker stands up .
O,"I rise in support of this resolution , Mr. Speaker ."
O,I rise tonight to fully endorse and authorize the use of Force One after another .
O,"Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of the authorization ."
O,I rise today in support of this resolution .
O,We will rally behind our president .
O,Sixteen in a row until Joan from California is recognized for a minute and a half .
O,We get to Barbara Lee .
O,"Mr. Speaker , members , I rise today really with a very heavy heart , one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week ."
O,Only the most foolish and the most callous would not understand the grief that has really gripped our people and millions across the world .
O,"Now , I have agonized over this vote , but I came to grips with it today and I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful yet very beautiful memorial service ."
O,"As a member of the clergy so eloquently said , as we act , let us not become the evil that we deplore ."
O,"Just after the vote , Barbara Lee says she was in the cloakroom again and she starts getting accosted by colleagues ."
O,"All of these friends are coming up to her and saying , you've got to go back ."
O,You .
O,You cannot vote this way .
O,"Yes , brought change in my vote ."
O,"One of them actually said to her , look , you've done so much on HIV , you've done so much on AIDS ."
O,This vote is going to take you out .
O,Think of the bigger picture .
O,You're saying you're dead .
O,"Yeah , but that's the right vote ."
O,I'm not going to give any president the authority to go to war .
O,And we don't know what we're doing .
O,"You know , the only Congress can declare war ."
O,"Help me on this , guys ."
O,Has the House vote .
O,OK .
O,House is just now finished .
O,That vote .
O,And we see one no vote during the final vote for the House was 420 to 1 .
O,We know it's a Democrat .
O,We don't yet know who will figure that out .
O,Barbara Lee was the only person in the Senate or the House to cast a no vote .
O,That must have been a very lonely moment .
O,"To be perfectly honest with you , I said some prayers for my friend ."
O,This was the right thing to do .
O,"And , you know , votes like this ."
O,You have to be ready to to pay the consequences over the next few weeks and months .
O,Her office was inundated with letters .
O,"Barbara Lee , you are a traitor and a disgrace to the office that you hold ."
O,You can find all these letters archived at Mills College .
O,You are a blight on American society .
O,Terrorist yourself .
O,So much hatred .
O,I don't know why you decided to place yourself into the camp of terror .
O,Those attacks came and they came and they came to deadline to death threats .
O,"Now , off to hell with you , Benedict Arnold want to be ."
O,And so I had to have security day and night .
O,Thanks for supporting the Taliban .
O,"Hey , Hanway , pep rally ."
O,What are you what do you believe in ?
O,"If you go to Mills College in Oakland and we sent a reporter there , you will find 60000 letters ."
O,They're not all negative .
O,But most are .
O,"But Congressman Lee says she never faltered because right after the vote , she was in her office ."
O,"My dad call me lieutenant colonel , retired in the Army ."
O,"He said , I'm really proud of you ."
O,"You know , my dad had been in Korea and World War Two ."
O,"I mean , he sees that the way I see it because I really wasn't sure ."
O,What do you saying ?
O,"As you know , I really wasn't sure ."
O,"She thought , all right ."
O,Daddy's proud of me .
O,"Now , we should note that Barbara Lee is still a congresswoman ."
O,She did not pay the price for that no vote .
O,"And whatever you think of her vote , whether you think it was the right thing to do is the wrong thing to do ."
O,"What is interesting to me is that as we're sitting here , looking back on 12 years of war , she was sitting there 12 years ago looking forward and maybe she saw something about how this would play out , but how these these words , these 60 words would start to grow and expand ."
O,That's next .
B-AD,This is Gregory Johnson .
I-AD,My name is Benjamin Whittis .
I-AD,"Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world ."
E-AD,More information about fulminant flounced artwork and this message .
O,"Hey , I'm Jad Abumrad ."
O,I'm Robert KRULWICH .
O,This is Radio Lab .
O,"And today , 60 words ."
O,This is a collaboration with BuzzFeed and reporter Gregory Johnsen .
O,Story is based on a an article that Gregory wrote about the 60 simple words that have really defined American counterterrorism for more than a decade .
O,It's called the Authorization for Use of Military Force that's shortened to a u m f and it was passed by Congress three days after September 11th .
O,"Here it is again , read by Senator John McCain , which says the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations organizations ."
O,All right .
O,So why would we be looking at that boring ass sentence ?
O,"He seems aimless , almost bored and saying , yeah , he does ."
O,Can I just be honest with you for a second ?
O,"I generally move through the world with the assumption which which has been proven over and over again to be true , that I don't know how the world works ."
O,Like somehow I missed that day at school or something .
O,Are you offering something specific ?
O,No .
O,"I'm free to a general sense that somehow , like Oz is out there behind the curtain pulling levers and I'm just always gonna be stuck on this side , you know ?"
O,"Yeah , I think it's what motivates the show for me is that like I just I feel kind of stupid most the time ."
O,And these shows are a way to engage the world and really examine the world .
O,Right .
O,Exactly .
O,"And when it comes to these matters of national security , I really feel clueless ."
O,"And so when I read Gregory's article , I felt like I understood something crucial for the first time ."
O,But the way words actually operate in the world .
O,"Because , again , this sentence , this totally boring sentence ."
O,"This is the legal foundation for everything that the U.S. has done , everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes to secret renditions , to seal raids ."
O,It's all been hung off these 60 words .
O,"One lawyer who is in the Bush administration said , look , this sentence is like a Christmas tree ."
O,All sorts of things have been hung off of this .
O,"But how , how ?"
O,Like because you did you read the thing and you don't see any mention of Guantanamo Bay in those 60 words .
O,It doesn't mention detention .
O,It doesn't mention drone strikes .
O,It doesn't mention drone strikes against American citizens .
O,You saw that guy .
O,"So when the first folks we call to help us decode this , that's that's John Bellinger ."
O,I served as the legal advisor for the National Security Council from 2001 to 2005 and as the legal advisor for the Department of State from 2005 to 2009 .
O,You can't do any speed dating within with a credential like that because the date will be over .
O,That's my congressional testimony voice .
O,"And we asked him like , okay , so weak detention isn't anywhere in this document ."
O,So how do you read detention from these 60 words ?
O,The argument with which I am comfortable as a legal matter is this .
O,He says if you go eight words into those 60 words and you get to the phrase all necessary and appropriate force .
O,All necessary .
O,Appropriate force .
O,Yeah .
O,"You gotta ask yourself , what is force ?"
O,What does that mean ?
O,What do you know ?
O,What force is that ?
O,I punch you in the face .
O,That's him using force .
O,That's one kind of foreign use force to kill people .
O,But a lesser use of force is to detain them .
O,Detention is simply lesser included in the use of force that comes naturally in a military operation .
O,"It's like a subset of force , basically ."
O,"So if you're authorized to use force to kill people , you are also by default authorized to use force to detain them , essentially to knock them out of the battle ."
O,In other ways .
O,And that that force is both necessary and it's appropriate .
O,And the courts have upheld that .
O,So that one word force .
O,Mm hmm .
O,That is how you justifying Guantanamo Bay .
O,All the controversy surrounding Guantanamo Bay continues .
O,The Authorization to Use Military Force Act has happened that military commissions have been the legal basis for the detention of thousands of individuals .
O,How many of them have been detained for more than 10 years ?
O,None have ever been charged .
O,And the words detention are never mentioned .
O,So that's attention .
O,It gets even trickier if you go just a few words past all necessary and appropriate force to work .
O,You get to the mention of the enemy who the force is supposed to be used against .
O,That's right .
O,And it seems to be your very limited language .
O,You mean we can't shoot everybody or anybody ?
O,No .
O,"Only the people who planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such sounds much more ."
O,"Sounds very much tethered to 9/11 , right ?"
O,Yeah .
O,Which is why a lot of congressmen and women voted for it .
O,"Joe Biden on the day of the vote , September 14th , 2001 ."
O,"He says , look , people don't freak out about this language ."
O,It's relates to the incident and his broad authority relating the incident .
O,"It does not relate to all terrorism , every everyplace , because we're just talking about al-Qaeda who did this and the Taliban who have harbored them ."
O,Right .
O,"No , not necessarily ."
O,"Gregory Johnson , again , over time , what's happened is there's been this other sort of all category that has been read into these 60 words , even though it appears nowhere in these 60 words and that catch all category is associated forces ."
O,Associated forces .
O,Yeah .
O,What we've been calling these 60 first and 60 second words onto it is special way .
O,"And if you define the enemy as al-Qaida , the Taliban and associated forces , it's a whole different ballgame ."
O,Yeah .
O,"So when you read those those all those words , it did not include the phrase associated forces is nowhere in the text to where it is ."
O,So then why could people cite something that isn't in the back ?
O,This is one of the enduring mysteries of of this .
O,So the earliest example that we could find of those two words is in a 2004 memo from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz .
O,"He defines an enemy as al-Qaida , the Taliban and associated forces ."
O,"But the truth is , it may have just been there from the beginning ."
O,"Mean , because according to Ben Whittis from the Brookings Institution , there is a concept in the laws of war called code belligerency ."
O,"It's the idea that if you're at war with person A and person B is on person is side in the war , you're also legally at war with person B ."
O,"Makes perfect sense if you think of it in traditional war terms , because like we're at war with Germany , Italy joined their side ."
O,"So by default , we're at war with Italy , too ."
O,Right .
O,So just transpose that here .
O,"If we're at war with this group called al-Qaeda and a certain set of groups that aren't them join the war on al-Qaeda side , then you are legally at war with them ."
O,"If you don't think about that , too hard is crystal clear ."
O,But then the question that has arisen over time is how broad do you make that that circle ?
O,"Because the problem , obviously , is that we're we're not talking about nation states anymore ."
O,We're talking about groups .
O,"So , OK , how close does the link to al-Qaeda and the people who carried out September 11th have to be ?"
O,So if you have someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who's connected to someone who is connected to September 11 .
O,Is that enough or is it only three links ?
O,Or can you be an associate of an associate ?
O,"Now , we can't exactly know how broadly the Obama and Bush administrations have defined those words ."
O,We'll talk about why in a second .
O,But you just have to look at the news .
O,All right .
O,And you could see that like we started with a war that was in Afghanistan and then spread to a lot of different places .
O,"Pakistan , Libya , Somalia , Yemen ."
O,Yeah .
O,"And in Yemen , there's a lot of debate and a lot of discussion about like , is this legal ?"
O,Does this have anything to do with September 11th anymore ?
O,"Because now the group in Yemen , al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula , which is a group that was first formed in 2009 , they have their own hierarchy and their own structure ."
O,"And it's not clear how and in what fashion they take orders from either Osama bin Laden , why he was still alive or now Ayman al-Zawahiri ."
O,So does this make them an associated force or does it make them part of al-Qaida ?
O,"The answer , at least on ."
O,"Good morning , everyone ."
O,"It is Friday , September 30th , 2011 ."
O,Market down on your calendar .
O,"December 30th , 2011 seemed to be ."
O,"Yes , when the U.S. assassinated two members of the group ."
O,"This is not confirmed yet , but it could very well have been a U.S. Predator drone strike ."
O,That is a U.S. government attack .
O,"And to put all this in context , between 2002 and 2014 , according to some estimates , there have been about 65 drone strikes in Yemen , killing about 400 people ."
O,So much hinges on how you define those words .
O,So much is in the definition .
O,"I asked the Pentagon , I said , who what are the list of associated forces ?"
O,"So al-Qaida , yes , the U.S. is at war ."
O,That's clear .
O,"What about the other groups , al al-Qaida in Iraq , al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb , armed Islamic Group Abu Sayyaf , Jamaah Islamiya ."
O,Brotherhood of this .
O,Brotherhood of that .
O,Who ?
O,Who are these groups ?
O,Who is the U.S. at war with ?
O,And the Pentagon emailed me back and they said the list is classified enough for public release .
O,Wait .
O,"So we who we are at war with , we don't know ."
O,"I Raitt's you're saying when you approached the Pentagon , they say that they will not tell you the names of the people we're at war against ."
O,"Well , maybe they shouldn't ."
O,Maybe that would be valuable .
O,"Well , they don't ."
O,"You want to know as a citizen of America who were fighting , on the other hand , do I want to know as the as if the United States has determined that I am dangerous to it ?"
O,"If it announces , then that would give me a certain amount of notice , which I made perhaps would be disadvantageous to the United States ."
O,"It could also , though , act as a disincentive for you to take action ."
O,"Maybe , but maybe not ."
O,"Maybe they will just get quieter , more dangerous ."
O,"I mean , it's true ."
O,There might be reasons for they have not wanted to provide a public list because they this is John Boundary and one the group's move all the time .
O,"And so a few say , well , these are associated groups ."
O,"Well , then certain people just move from group to group B and they also want to leave these different groups guessing ."
O,But it still raises Democratic concerns if the American people don't really know who the executive branch believes is covered by the EU IMF .
O,"In a democracy and in a representative democracy , that has to be weighed out ."
O,"Should the citizens of the United States know who it is that the United States is targeting for death around the world , who it is that the United States is technically at war with ?"
O,"Should war be a decision that the citizens of a democracy , of a representative democracy have a say ?"
O,"Well , we're a representative democracy , as you just said ."
O,So I'm assuming that the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee knows every item on that list .
O,I'm not so sure .
O,"Morning , everybody ."
O,The committee meets today to receive testimony on the law of armed conflict .
O,"One of the more interesting Senate hearings took place in early 2013 , hitting the status of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force ."
O,"The EU IMF , it was the Senate Armed Services Committee ."
O,"Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the committee ."
O,Senator McCain is on the committee .
O,He'd like to welcome our witnesses .
O,And Gregory says the senators called a couple of Defense Department officials to answer questions .
O,"Members Committee , thank you for the opportunity to testify about the legal framework for the U.S. military operations to defend our nation , because they want to know , like now that we're 12 years into this war ."
O,How are you using this document ?
O,Does it need to be changed ?
O,"So the Department of Defense officials and there were four of them necessary and came and said , look , I believe that existing authorities are adequate for this armed conflict ."
O,Don't revisit this sentence .
O,Don't repeal it .
O,This sentence is sufficient .
O,It gives us all the power that we need against al-Qaida and associated forces .
O,"And as they're laying out their case , they say those two words associated force , the associated forces and associated forces over associated forces and over an associated force and associated forces and associated force and their associated forces , associated force and associated forces ."
O,"Instead of just nodding along , a lot of the senators were like , what ?"
O,I've only been here five months .
O,But this is the most astounding and most astoundingly disturbing hearing that I've been to since I've been here .
O,You guys have essentially rewritten the constitution here today .
O,"That's Angus King , independent senator from Maine ."
O,And you keep using the term associated forces .
O,You use it 13 times in your statement .
O,That is not in the EU IMF .
O,And you said at one point it suits us very well .
O,I assume it does suit you very well because you're reading it to cover everything and anything .
O,"But one of the most striking moments of this hearing is when the head of the committee , Senator Carl Levin , turns to one of the D.O.D. officials and asks him , is there a list ?"
O,"Now , is there an existing list of groups that are affiliated with al-Qaeda ?"
O,"Senator , I'm not sure there is a list per say , I'm very familiar with the organizations that we do consider ."
O,"Right now , our affiliate al-Qaida and I could provide you that list ."
O,Would you ?
O,Would you give us that ?
O,"Yes , sir ."
O,We can do that .
O,"And when you add or subtract names from that list , would you let us know ?"
O,"We can do that as well , Mr. Chairman ."
O,Q Let me just see if I understand what you just said at a committee hearing .
O,"Yes , sir ."
O,"A U.S. senator asked specifically , so who's on the list of people were allowed to kill ?"
O,Right .
O,"That suggested that the Senate Armed Services Committee who had oversight , really had no idea what or like ."
O,All right .
O,"If we don't have any idea who were at war with the Senate Armed Services Committee , doesn't seem to have any idea , then who does ?"
O,"Well , one of the things that became clear to me as I was reporting on this story was that many of the people who were making these decisions had never been elected by anyone to any position ."
O,"And they were the ones who were making the decision , not the elected representative ."
O,And so who are they ?
O,You see ?
O,"I guess so , yeah ."
O,"So we're rooting around for a while , looking for an answer to that question until we found this guy ."
O,This is Daniel Kleinman .
O,He's a journalist .
O,And I've covered national security and counterterrorism for many years .
O,"And based on hundreds of confidential interviews that became his book , Kill or Capture , he was able to paint a picture for us of who makes these decisions and how he told us about these meetings ."
O,You say it's s t.v.'s meanings .
O,What are they ?
O,Who's in the room ?
O,How did the events unfold ?
O,"Well , these are they call them civets meetings in the vernacular of the bureaucracy ."
O,It stands for secure video teleconference meetings .
O,Described them as a sort of a massive top secret Google Hangout chat where literally hundreds of people from throughout the national security bureaucracy log in to decide who's on the list and who isn't and who should live and who should die .
O,"You should literally hundreds , literally hundreds of people ."
O,"Now , many of them are backbenchers ."
O,"They're not participating in the call , but they're taking notes before they get together in this meeting ."
O,"Many of the folks at this meeting , he says , are given little packets of information on each target ."
O,They call them baseball cards because they sort of look like you got a picture and some stats like Yogi Berra on one side and then you've got his batting average and his hometown on the backwell .
O,That the terrorist equivalent of all of that .
O,So who is this person ?
O,Where does he rank and what kinds of operations has he been involved in in the past ?
O,"Eventually , a general will come on the screen and say , here's our target objective , Akron ."
O,"For some reason , he says , they always refer to the targets by the name of American cities objective Toledo ."
O,General might say Target is in Yemen .
O,We have a drone overhead .
O,There's an opportunity to kill this person .
O,Can we legally do it ?
O,"And the fascinating thing , although maybe it won't come as much of a surprise , is that the people he's making this pitch to are not generals , but lawyers ."
O,There are lawyers everywhere .
O,"That is just a basic fact of modern warfare , says John Bellinger ."
O,"You know of lawyers on the ground with artillery units , tank commanders , lawyers in Kevlar lawyers and helicopters ."
O,They are lawyers really almost behind every bomb .
O,Just lawyers everywhere .
O,And that's a very good thing .
O,That's Harold Koh .
O,"He was the top lawyer at the State Department from 2009 to 2013 , because it means that we're not just shooting away at people willy nilly or because we're angry at them ."
O,Right .
O,They are considered careful decision .
O,"Now , Harold Koh , according to Dan Claiborne's reporting , was in those civets meetings and he would often be the one to answer the general's questions ."
O,Can we legally kill this person ?
O,"So we asked him , like , if lawyers are now the ones deciding who we are at war with and who we aren't ."
O,How do you do it ?
O,"And unfortunately for us , I know that I'm get into that on this call ."
O,There are multiple methods .
O,But I'm not going to go into that .
O,He said he couldn't comment on any of it because it's classified .
O,"But Harold Koh is a creative law , according to Dan Klaidman , who spoke to a lot of people familiar with the process ."
O,"Koh in particular , had a fascinating way of determining who is and is not an associated force ."
O,"In other words , we are or aren't at war with ."
O,And it seems to be less about the groups as a whole and more about individuals within the group .
O,"For example , seniority , that was an important issue for Koh ."
O,"If you're going to target a guy , he has to be a senior member of group like al-Qaida , right ?"
O,Yes .
O,To be able to give orders and he has to be unique within the organization .
O,"You couldn't simply under Herald Coast theory , go after , say , a driver or a cook who was in al-Qaeda or even footsoldiers because they were fungible , meaning they could be easily replaced ."
O,Another criteria was whether they were externally oriented for Koh .
O,"If they were just participants in a civil war , you couldn't target them ."
O,"But if they were targeting westerners or western interests , then yes ."
O,So if you take Dan klaidman's account of Harold Koh's criteria as a representative and we person have no way of verifying it .
O,"But if you take that as the norm , then maybe there is a strong vetting process in place ."
O,But I interviewed numerous people who participated in these meetings and one of the things that I heard over and over again was that there was this kind of inexorable momentum toward killing .
O,And that the military people in these meetings could speak with a kind of a tone of do-or-die urgency .
O,"In fact , to the people who I quote in my book used exactly the same metaphor to describe that sense of momentum that was very difficult to resist ."
O,It was like standing on a train track with a train hurtling toward them at 100 miles an hour .
O,"Then I guess , like ."
O,"The important question for me is like , how often do they say no ?"
O,"Well , the answer been 99 times yes ."
O,And one time no .
O,Or 50 times yes and 50 times no .
O,"You know , how many no's are there ?"
O,"Well , look , I'd say I did not come across many , many examples , but he did ."
O,Tell us about this one instance .
O,This was a meeting between the top lawyer at the Defense Department and a man named Jay Johnson and the top lawyer at the State Department who was then Harold Koh .
O,Harold Koh .
O,"And according to dance sources , Harold Koh and Jay Johnson were faced with determining the fate of a 40 year old man , roughly 40 , named Shafe Mukhtar Rabbo ."
O,I think that's the right to say his name .
O,I'm not sure he was a member of these Somali group al-Shabab .
O,"And for context , news World Cup celebrations have turned to tragedy in the Central African nation of Uganda a few months before this conversation ."
O,"This is in 2010 , al-Shabab bombed a rugby club and a restaurant at the same time in Uganda , killing 74 people ."
O,"Broken chairs , smashed tables and the sounds of pain as rescuers search for the living and the dead ."
O,So that had just happened .
O,"And according to Dan Klaidman , at this moment in intelligence circles , there was a debate raging as to whether al-Shabaab should or should not be considered an associated force at the time , their leader had sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden ."
O,But their agenda was primarily a local agenda .
O,They had never struck out against the United States or against American interests in the region .
O,So you've got the top lawyer at the State Department and the top lawyer at the Pentagon facing off as to whether this fellow robo from al-Shabaab should live or die .
O,How does this work ?
O,Does somebody just like just someone pound the table ?
O,Yes .
O,This was this was a very heated meeting .
O,Jay Johnson argued vehemently that Robo was covered under the EU IMF .
O,"He was , after all , a founding member of al-Shabab ."
O,Harold Koh vehemently disagreed .
O,"Harold Koh's conclusion , based on the evidence and the intelligence that he saw , was that Roba was not externally focused ."
O,"In fact , he belonged to a faction of al-Shabab that was arguing against attacking the United States and other Western interests ."
O,"So , according to Klaidman , these two men went back and forth and back and forth until eventually Harold Koh just drew a hard line and essentially said , look , if you do this , you need to know that you will be doing it over the unambiguous objections of the State Department's legal adviser , the UN ambiguous ."
O,And that's very strong language coming from a lawyer .
O,"And the signal that it's sent to the White House was you'll be taking military action , even though the top lawyer at the State Department said that this would be an illegal action ."
O,So what happened ?
O,Did they decide not to ?
O,They did not do it .
O,This is not academic .
O,It's lives depend on which way the decision goes .
O,President Barack Obama has authorized the disaster response .
O,"People who planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks , what's happening right now ?"
O,"How can you help me , non-preferred on September 11th , 2001 , or ."
O,We'll continue in a moment .

O,K. Amjad Abu Moron .
O,I'm Robert KRULWICH .
O,This is Radiolab .
O,Today we've devoted the intro .
O,"We're continuing to devote the entire show to a single sentence , one sentence , 60 words , that's all ."
O,"It's the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force was signed into law on September 18th , 2001 ."
O,"And together with BuzzFeed and reporter Gregory Johnsen , we have we have manhandled these words ."
O,"Yeah , we have dissect it ."
O,We have bisected to dissect it .
O,And whatever other kind of sector you quod resected to the EU IMF as it's called .
O,Yes .
O,"And you know , we've looked at how the sentence has defined our last 12 years of counter-terrorism and now how will it define our future ."
O,"Gentlemen , thank you for being here today ."
O,This is a very soon .
O,We were thinking about that Senate Armed Services Committee hearing .
O,"We ended up calling someone who sat on the committee , Tim Kaine , senator from Virginia , and who was there that day ."
O,"Yeah , that was a that was a very human kind of hair raising day ."
O,"And Senator Kaine told us that one of the most hair raising moments for him was when one of his fellow senators , Lindsey Graham , asked one of the Department of Defense officials , do you agree with me ?"
O,"The war against radical Islam or terror , whatever description like to provide will go on after the second term of President Obama ."
O,"In other words , how long do you think this particular war has declared in the section is going to go on then , in my judgment ?"
O,This is going to go on for quite a while .
O,"And , yes , beyond the second term of the president and beyond this term of Congress ."
O,"Yes , sir ."
O,I think it's at least 10 to 20 years .
O,"It was chilling because like this is already the longest war in the history , the United States , along with Vietnam and now a D.O.D. official is saying add on 10 or 20 years ."
O,"So I said , is it the administration's position that you tell me if if somebody is born after 9/11 , let's imagine in 2030 they join a group that has just become associated with al-Qaida in 2030 ?"
O,"Is it the administration's position that the AMF would would cover them and those organizations and without hesitation , the the administration witnesses said , yes , as long as they become an associated force under the legal standard that was set out ."
O,"It's not limited in time , not limited in geography ."
O,Really troubling .
O,"But , you know , I'm also troubled by another thing ."
O,"I mean , you know , the iconic it's a New York picture of ."
O,V-J Day Kesten Times Square .
O,"A combination of everything from August 14th , 1945 ."
O,There ought to be a day where those who have served in war that you declare that the war is over and then you celebrate them .
O,All these people have made up the right .
O,You get asked sometimes by service families like when is this going to end ?
O,Does it ever come up ?
O,"Yes , yes , yes ."
O,"You told us it's something like one in three people in his state of Virginia are connected to the military , so he does get that question a lot ."
O,"And the truth is , we all want a V-J Day ."
O,We need it .
O,"And so seven days after that Senate Armed Services Committee hearing , President Obama , it is a great honor ."
O,"Gave a speech to return to the National Defense University , where he seems to say basically ."
O,It's time .
O,"This war , like all wars , must end ."
O,That's what history advises matters why I intend to engage Congress about the existing authorization to use military force or a U.N. that basically announces that he would like to get rid of those 60 words .
O,And in this war .
O,"Yeah , but common sense tells you that these are different kind of enemy , not a state or a government , they're just so they make war in a different way ."
O,Senator McCain has a great line .
O,"He goes , look , we're in an age of warfare where the war isn't going to end with the signing of a peace treaty on the deck of the destroyer ."
O,That's not how it happens these days .
O,There's no clear start in ending .
O,"And yet the president , he wants to end the war , says bandwidths , and every war has come to an end ."
O,"He sees himself as a person who came in to a country fighting two wars , and he brought them all to an end ."
O,And I think he wants to have done that .
O,But how how do you how do you do that ?
O,How do you end a war when the vast amount of people that you're calling the enemy haven't stopped fighting ?
O,"So what he does , America cannot in the May speech and its extremely clever ."
O,"And by the way , it's really well lawyered is he announces a set of rules going forward for drone strike ."
O,America does not take strikes to punish individuals .
O,We act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people that he's only going to use drone strikes when there's an imminent threat capable of effect .
O,"And it's well understood by people who understand this kind of stuff that in the Constitution and also in international law , the president is allowed to act unilaterally in self-defense when there is an imminent threat , meaning it's urgent and you can't feasibly capture that person ."
O,"Ben fears that what President Obama was doing there by stressing that word , an imminent threat to the American people is that he was laying a new foundation ."
O,"You saying when the EU IMF ends and I wanted to end , I do have another way of justifying all these things ."
O,Maybe they wouldn't change .
O,So the drone strikes and the raids would continue as long as you have a capacious enough understanding of what the word imminent means .
O,You might be able to continue a whole lot of this stuff and then you don't have to go to Congress at all .
O,And you can say you've ended the war and the human rights groups will cheer for you and we're going to mysteriously find that there are a whole lot of imminent threats for freedom .
O,Thank you very much .
O,But God bless .
O,God blessed us .
O,"And in the context of what happened to those 60 words , you do have to wonder what's going to happen to a word like imminent ."
O,"And all the while , according to Ben Whittis and pretty much everyone we spoke with ."
O,We haven't really answered the big questions when do we want to attack the enemy ?
O,Who is the enemy ?
O,"And if we're going to be fighting them , even when we're not technically at war with them , then what's the difference between war and peace ?"
O,And that's why this whole subject is so unsettling .
O,"If you don't know the common sense definition anymore of when you're at war and when you're at peace , then how do you how do you write rules ?"
O,"OK , so we get a cut in here , we produced that episode in April of 2014 ."
O,"And as I mentioned at the top of the episode , this the reason this came to mind for us ."
O,"Now , the reason we decide to rerelease this podcast is , is what happened four days ago ."
O,A U.S. drone strike killed the head of Iran's Quds Force as General Kassam Suleimani .
O,He was at the Baghdad International Airport .
O,"The assassination , if you want to call it that , people debate whether you should call it ."
O,That seems pretty clear to me .
O,That's what it was .
O,That has set off a chain of events that we have no idea where it's going to lead .
O,"But it did raise a basic question for us , which is how is the United States government justifying this ?"
O,Is this an a UML type situation or has that been phased out ?
O,"And are we seeing what Benjamin Wittes was worrying about more than five years ago , that it's some kind of imminent threat type justification ?"
O,Just raised a lot of questions for us .
O,And so .
O,"Hello , how are you doing ?"
O,"Hey , we got Benjamin Whittis back on the line to give us his take ."
O,"He is a senior editor at the Brookings Institution , editor in chief at the blog Lawfare ."
O,He had a bit of a cold .
O,"The first thing that he told us is that even though Obama President Obama pledged to get rid of the EU IMF in that clip that we played in the episode , it's still very much here , very much in effect ."
O,It is still doing a lot of work .
O,It was the basis for the anti ISIS campaign or one of the bases for the anti-ISIS campaign .
O,It remains the basis for a variety of overseas counterterrorism operations .
O,"It remains the legal basis for a whole lot of detention operations , including Guantanamo Bay ."
O,It is also the case that we have .
O,"Started to confront a variety of issues in which the even the endlessly stretchy and elastic a U.N. math does not obviously get you to one of them , for example , is Iranian backed militias in in Iraq ."
O,These are not in any sense associated forces of al-Qaeda .
O,"And so what the Trump administration has done , he says , and by the way , they were not the first to do this ."
O,They've taken that stretchy AOL math from 2001 and they've added things to it to make it even stretch here .
O,"Namely , they have begun to call upon this whole collection of loose unidentified powers that the Constitution gives a president in order to protect the United States ."
O,"Quote in the Wall Street Journal , The Pentagon was careful not to say imminent in its statement about the killing Suleimani ."
O,"What did they say , if not that ?"
O,"Let me pull the statement , because I think the statement is interesting and worth passing ."
O,State and so money .
O,"OK , so it is a three paragraph statement ."
O,"The first paragraph reads at the direction of the president , the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing custom ."
O,"Suleimani , the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force , a U.S. designated foreign terrorist organization ."
O,So the key words there are decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad .
O,Right .
O,And so that is invoking the idea of preemptive self-defense .
O,Right .
O,We we believe he was going to attack U.S. forces or personnel abroad .
O,So we took action to neutralize that threat .
O,"The second paragraph , General , so he was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region ."
O,Suleimani and his coulds force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more .
O,"So there you have situating the current threat claim against a past pattern and practice of a robust series of attacks that , in fact , killed a lot of such people ."
O,Then the next sentence is .
O,"He had worked in the orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months , including the attack on December twenty seventh , culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel ."
O,General Suleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad that took place this week .
O,"So now we're talking about contemporary activity , all of which sounds , although it never really says it outright , that there was some kind of imminent threat that needed to be dealt with ."
O,But then the statement throws you a curveball .
O,"Because the last paragraph reads , This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans ."
O,The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and interests wherever they are in the world .
O,"Now , deterrence is not a imminent threat issue ."
O,Right .
O,And so the implication there is we're trying to send them a message .
O,And that is a very different theory .
O,And so I don't actually know how to read the totality of that statement .
O,It seems to say it invokes it is suggestive of imminence without saying it .
O,It suggests that the fundamental theory is a force protection theory .
O,"And then it also shifts gears and talks about deterrence , which strikes me as sounding in a completely different set of values ."
O,"And so I found the statement pretty confusing , to be honest ."
O,It sounds like a sort of the legal version of a choose your own adventure in a way that's exactly right .
O,"So it's a little bit of choose your own adventure , but it's also , perhaps more importantly , it's we need all the adventures in order to because if you just rely on the self-defense and troop defense thing , then the question becomes , well , what are the troops even doing there ?"
O,Right .
O,You need the a.u maps to get the troops there in the first place .
O,So what you what you were worried about back in 2014 about like this drift that would happen .
O,"Where the EU IMF would get stretched , but then also things would get layered onto it to where it's impossible to know the borders anymore ."
O,Who's our actual enemy and who isn't ?
O,And what even is war in this context ?
O,"Yeah , that's exactly right ."
O,And this is not at a Trump thing .
O,It started in the Bush administration .
O,It accelerated in the Obama administration and it continues now .
O,The executive hoards war powers .
O,"On the other hand , Congress deserves a great deal of the blame here ."
O,"Members , individual members and Senator Tim Kaine deserves a real shout out here , have tried to assert a kind of principled limits on allowing this drift to take place ."
O,But the actual posture of institutionally of Congress is it doesn't push back against these theories .
O,It doesn't clarify the law .
O,And that constitutes acceptance of these statutes that are meant for very different purposes being understood as authorizing these activities that they're kind of jerry rigged to support .
O,And the Sulaimani case is a really good example of this .
O,It is a kind of a crazy expansion of what I had thought the parameters of our legal fight against terrorism looked like .
O,And to have it done on a Donald Trump temper tantrum without a sort of meaningful congressional involvement strikes me as as democratically baffling .
O,We expect that things will .
O,Likely change pretty rapidly and we'll do our best to update this episode as they do .
