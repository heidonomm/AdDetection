O,"Unwell , unwell ."
O,It's Alex and Sophia back at it .
O,All right .
O,"For the second time , actually , today , it's call her dad ."
O,Call her daddy .
O,I think it was last week or two weeks ago we uploaded our episode and the sound quality was complete shit .
O,So we had to throw that in the garbage and rerecord it .
O,This week we went to upload our episode .
O,"I felt really , really good about it , only to see that the file said zero bites b y t ."
O,Yes .
O,What does that mean ?
O,I don't fucking know .
O,Guys recording literally for the Zygon time today and it is like I can't explain the pain when I took out the SD card and I put it into my little editor .
O,I went to start editing this audio and I said .
O,"While my audio is there , but Sophia's somehow Sophia's audio lumper , no , I didn't I swear on my microphone ."
O,"Because this puts me through pain , too , that I had to redo this ."
O,So we're literally about to have to rerecord another episode .
O,"And it's like , I don't want to let it out on them ."
O,No .
O,"Like , I can't help but be fresh snow ."
O,This is gonna be a complete different bosox .
O,I can't fuckin sit here and say the same shit for another two hours .
O,No .
O,So we're just gonna have to really go with this one .
O,It hurt .
O,I can't even explain it .
O,No podcast for two hours .
O,"And then you look and it's like , yes , Alex's podcast it alone ."
O,Whereas Sofia .
O,"And the other thing is like when we saw the zero bite file , we said , what is a zero bite file ?"
O,"We spent the next six , seven hours being like , no , no , no , no , no , no ."
O,We can retrieve this .
O,I was on the phone with Geek Squad .
O,We got on fucking up or we were trying to reach out to audio technician .
O,"We were putting up our own money and we were like , we will pay you four hundred dollars out of pocket if you can figure out what the fuck zero bite ."
O,Cause I don't fucking know .
O,"And yeah , nothing was recovered ."
O,So here we are back at it again for another motherfucking episode .
O,"Of course , daddy ."
O,But it's all right .
O,It's OK .
O,I'm losing it a little bit .
O,It's all right .
O,Your eyes are blood .
O,Thank you .
O,Thank you .
O,Alex is doing especially bad .
O,I'm not doing my best .
O,I'm dealing with a little thing I would like to call sleep paralysis .
O,Why is there a light ?
O,"I mean , there are windows ."
O,Okay .
O,I'm probably hallucinating .
O,"I am sleep paralysis when I sleep paralysis , Sofia ."
O,I'm going to take a quick nap .
O,You let them know .
O,So sleep paralysis is .
O,I've had it before .
O,It's a common phenomenon .
O,And what happens is you wake up in the middle of the night and you wake up completely petrified and you can't move your limbs and you can't make a sound .
O,Yeah .
O,And you're alive .
O,You lay there paralyzed and everyone experiences it a little bit differently .
O,"Like for some people , it's like there's an evil spirit like up above them levitating ."
O,Yeah .
O,"I mean , how is it for you ?"
O,"I literally last night or two nights ago , I woke up and there I believed was a man sitting on the edge of my bed , just staring at me , sleeping ."
O,And I was so fucking terrified .
O,"You guys paralyzed , couldn't move the whole thing ."
O,"And then for the next like now , few nights I haven't been able to sleep because of this terrifying feeling of , oh , my God , if I go back to sleep , is this gonna happen again ?"
O,Yeah .
O,"Sometimes what happens is if you regretting this , if you partake in partying like there are like drugs at the party and you decide to partake ."
O,Sometimes you will have sleep paralysis like a few days later .
O,"Well , I'm not on it like specifically MDMA ."
O,Like a couple to me .
O,I don't know .
O,Are you remix imperia .
O,I should all just help .
O,So it feels like .
O,So when I take MDMA literally like all fucking off my rocker a few days .
O,"If anyone's taking ecstasy or Molly , please be aware that this could happen anywhere ."
O,Disclaimer OK .
O,China's like that right by me .
O,"Okay , I'm over it ."
O,I'm fine .
O,But I will say I think a lot of people are having bad dreams right now .
O,Like very vivid dreams because of Corona .
O,I actually tweeted about that because I had a dream when I was asleep .
O,That all .
O,Have you ever had this dream ?
O,All of your teeth fall out ?
O,Yes .
O,I feel like everyone experiences that .
O,And I guess some guy wrote and told me that it's when you are experiencing extreme anxiety and going through a change either in a relationship or your job .
O,"And I guess obviously right now it applies to Corona , too ."
O,It's like the unknown .
O,So I guess .
O,"Well , actually , you reminded me of you ."
O,How are your dreams over ?
O,"So a few days ago , this is really weird ."
O,I had a dream that I was putting like living things in the microwave .
O,"And I woke up in the middle of the night like so scared and like , feeling horrible ."
O,You were putting living things and I like her waiting fuck is wrong .
O,What I remember is going on over there .
O,"From what I remember , I was putting like babies and like animals ."
O,"Guys , I know I woke up feeling bad ."
O,It was very strange .
O,I don't know what's going on .
O,"One day , I mean , I don't fuck with you anymore ."
O,That's weird .
O,"Anyway , anyways ."
O,So .
O,"So if you know we're thinking about this , we feel really bad ."
O,Yeah .
O,We feel really bad for all of the high school seniors and college seniors because we see a lot of you are not able to partake or grad school and graduation and all those fun senior week activities .
O,"Yeah , and it sucks ."
O,"And I think a lot of Europe said like I saw these daddy and girls were having prom on Xoom , like they're getting in their prom dresses and they're getting on zoomin ."
O,It fucking sucks .
O,"Yeah , but I just want to say , you know , having gone through high school and college and having made it out alive , I know it seems like the most important thing in your life right now ."
O,Goes on .
O,It's really not .
O,We've never really talked about .
O,Did you graduate high school ?
O,Are you fucking .
O,I'm not the type of person that would get their g._e._d numbers .
O,Anything wrong with that ?
O,But why do I think you got your g._e._d ?
O,The fact that you just looked me in my eyes and asked you if I graduated high school .
O,We never talk about high .
O,I barely graduate .
O,There you go .
O,There you go .
O,So you were to Jenny in high school ?
O,"Oh , I was ."
O,So .
O,Was that .
O,What kind of high school did you go to ?
O,I went to a private Catholic high school .
O,I went to a .
O,This was a fucking twist .
O,I went to a private boarding school .
O,"And I know people would look at me and be like , oh , you rich bitch ."
O,"No , absolutely fucking not ."
O,I got a scholarship to go there .
O,"I play soccer , which sounds weird to play sweet ."
O,So boarding school ?
O,"Yes , a boarding school ."
O,So like we had straight up boarders and day students and like people would like fuck in the dorms and shit .
O,"Oh , I was like a college in high school ."
O,I lived in the dorms in Ohio .
O,You would be Dell .
O,My you would all be with us .
O,I wouldn't know .
O,"So you graduated , but barely ."
O,I barely graduated in high school .
O,It was like it was the type of thing I started out with flying colours .
O,"Like I remember when I started out , I was like any PE classes ."
O,This is how bad it is .
O,I started high school .
O,"Two math classes advanced from my freshman year grade , my senior year of high school ."
O,"I was one behind of everybody else , I think ."
O,I don't even know about Hafid .
O,Huge drop off .
O,You really slid back .
O,You really .
O,You really went back .
O,"Yeah , that's great ."
O,So what about you ?
O,I I .
O,I didn't do great in high school either .
O,I remember my graduation specifically .
O,Our dean of students had just like been so done with me .
O,And I was missing my tassel for my cap and I was wearing the wrong gown .
O,And he just came up to me .
O,He was also so fucking hot .
O,"And he came up to me and was like , where's your tassel ?"
O,What is he ?
O,Are you wearing the wrong ?
O,I don't know .
O,I don't know .
O,"I , like , grabbed your sister ."
O,I don't remember .
O,I don't I know it's fucked up .
O,"And he just looked at me and was like , I don't care what you do anymore , Alex ."
O,Just fucking graduate .
O,Wow .
O,"I was like , oh , my God , I did not say he wanted ."
O,"Well , also kind of that ."
O,"Okay , so in college , what was your college situation ?"
O,Did you go to your college graduation ?
O,"I did it , but it wasn't like what everyone imagines it to be like ."
O,"I literally was like pissed the whole time I sat through the whole thing and I threw my diploma in the back of the car and is like , can we get my GED ?"
O,"Yeah , dude , college graduation , especially if you go to like a big university ."
O,I remember not wanting to go to mine .
O,I only went for my parents .
O,I actually barely graduated college too .
O,"Okay , good ."
O,That's another one .
O,Started off with flying colors .
O,"I started this amazing , wonderful college outside of San Francisco , California ."
O,Incredible .
O,Ended up at community college .
O,And you should so feel we love to see it .
O,Why ?
O,What happened ?
O,Too much degeneracy .
O,"Yeah , Jizo ."
O,I think I got like a ticket for underage drinking .
O,I don't fucking know .
O,Yeah .
O,"And your mom was like , come home ."
O,Yeah .
O,"She was like , I'm not paying this tuition ."
O,I think we had very different college experiences .
O,My college experience was like I couldn't get in .
O,I had to keep getting in trouble on the down low because obviously I would have lost my scholar .
O,Right .
O,I got in trouble .
O,I couldn't get an underage I couldn't like all that shit .
O,I will never forget I for a final exam .
O,"I was really struggling in this one class and I knew he was a huge fan of the teacher , the best one of the guy I was dating at the time and I was a professional athlete and I bribed him and I got him a signed ball and tickets ."
O,And in exchange for me to not have to take the final exam and for an A .
O,I like how how pathetic am I ?
O,"I feel like , come on ."
O,Hi .
O,"Come on , Alex ."
O,Slow .
O,"I showed up with a little bag and tickets and he's like , here it right , you fucking cunt ."
O,That's I think that might be the craziest thing I've ever heard come out of you .
O,But you've got to do what you gotta do .
O,Yeah .
O,Right .
O,"Now , that professor is probably getting fired ."
O,"No , like he's a great guy ."
O,"We still stay in touch , actually ."
O,"But then with the rest of my college experience , I know I have ."
O,"I have never talked about this , but ."
O,"Well , you know , but the daddy doesn't fully know my experience with college ."
O,I had a full scholarship to play Division 1 soccer at Boston University .
O,"You know , Brown Brownwood Brag ."
O,"I worked my whole life for it and I played only for 3 years , though , my senior year ."
O,"I got to keep my full scholarship , but I did not have to play and getting and ."
O,"Oh , no , no ."
O,That is a story for another day .
O,Okay .
O,"I was going to say like , why ?"
O,Why episode ?
O,I know .
O,No .
O,"Tell that story one day , but yeah ."
O,"So , I mean , anyone that college , high school life goes on ."
O,"I mean , look at us ."
O,"I mean , we almost flunked out of high school and college ."
O,Look at us now with the most degenerate podcaster .
O,Know we're like .
O,Show your parents us .
O,"Now , look at this ."
O,"They're like , no ."
O,That's the opposite of what we want our children to aspire .
O,"Know , we're like every parent's worst nightmare ."
O,"They're like doctor , lawyer , accountant , hard pastor ."
O,"No , no podcast ."
O,"Welcome back to the show , folks ."
O,"So I don't know , we just wanted to say shout out to all of you guys ."
O,Happy graduation .
O,Get fucked out with your parents .
O,Get fucked up on the other end .
O,Don't worry .
O,"You'll look back and you'll be like , what ?"
O,It's so much fun graduating on zoo .
O,"Oh , it's so depressing ."
O,All right .
O,Moving on .
O,People are getting horny .
O,Everybody is masturbating because we're staying at home and everybody is playing with themselves at home .
O,They are .
O,"And you know , you're going to play with yourself , with Adam and Eve ."
O,Adam and Eve .
O,"Guys , you know the drill ."
O,"They have all the sex toys , all the lube ."
O,Anything you can possibly imagine .
O,"Adam and Eve has for your sex life , whether you're fucking your partner , you're fucking yourself , Adam and motherfucking ."
O,There is a lot of masturbating going on .
O,"So Adam and Eve , right now , you can choose almost any one item for 50 percent off , 50 percent off mother fuckers ."
O,"Plus , when you do , you're gonna get 10 free gifts ."
O,Free again .
O,Free .
O,Yeah .
O,So you guys use offer code .
O,"Her daddy , that's her daddy at checkout ."
O,"Also , guys , they have thousands of products ."
O,So you guys can go shop around and see whatever you like .
O,"I know some girls you probably like don't if you don't have a vibrator , get like a starter ."
O,"Then if you guys are in into those anal beads , go get yourself some fucking anal beads ."
O,"Adam , you harm her daddy ."
O,Let's talk about let's talk about something else here .
O,A little something that's pretty spectacular .
O,Okay .
O,This is the thing .
O,This segment is for people that want to keep their love interest interested during quarantine .
O,"Yeah , that's what it is ."
O,"Yeah , that's a big problem , right ?"
O,"Big problem , for example ."
O,My cousin was talking to me actually about this the other day .
O,So my cousin met a guy at a bar that she really hit it off with a few days before .
O,And Shane and she's extremely picky .
O,So this was like a really big deal .
O,Okay .
O,"And now naturally , she's freaking out and she's calling me and she's asking me for advice on what the fuck to do right about this guy ."
O,"Which which I guess because your cousin's wondering , like , how do I keep this connection a lie right now for the foreseeable future ?"
O,"Like , we don't know and we'll never see another human again ."
O,Yeah .
O,She has no fucking idea what to do .
O,Right .
O,"And you know , what I want to say is I think a lot of people that are in the same boat are having the same anxiety ."
O,"And the problem is that because of the excited they're over doing , they're scared this person is gonna move on ."
O,And so they're like blowing up that person's phone and making sure that they're in constant contact with that person .
O,And that is the worst possible thing you can do right now .
O,The the word war .
O,"Yes , daddy ."
O,"Gang , if you take one thing from this episode , the worst ."
O,So .
O,"So , motherfuckers ."
O,"Well , the fuckin daddy did a lot of trial and error ."
O,And we did research extensively on My Lai .
O,He's using me as the guinea pig .
O,"And we believe that the answer and what you guys should be doing is disappearing , disappearing ."
O,And I know a lot of you are unhappy .
O,You just hearing that .
O,They're hearing that throwing their phone .
O,Yes .
O,Exciting .
O,Went through the roof .
O,A panic attack .
O,"Explain it to them , OK ."
O,I actually have an example from my past .
O,OK .
O,I remember it was a few years back .
O,I met this guy during Sundance .
O,"So for those of you don't know what that is , it's a film festival that they have in Utah ."
O,So it was the second I met him .
O,It was like fireworks .
O,We ended up spending I think it was like three nights .
O,Back to back to back together .
O,Did you find .
O,Colleagues don't kiss and tell you slight .
O,What ?
O,Tell us .
O,I did hold off until the second day .
O,You're like I held off for 24 hours and then it was go up and you please .
O,I'm OK .
O,So sex was great .
O,It was amazing .
O,Then he had to fly back to the East Coast .
O,I was stuck in fucking Utah .
O,So you can imagine how depressing that was .
O,And it was one of those things where I could not stop thinking about him .
O,Yeah .
O,And I started freaking out .
O,"I'm like , no , no , no , this is my husband ."
O,"He doesn't know yet , but I really think this could be the one ."
O,Love in my whole life .
O,Then you know your life .
O,"He's like , well , no , he felt it , too ."
O,Right .
O,"Right , right ."
O,Okay .
O,"No , of course ."
O,"So anyway , so in the beginning , when he flew back , we were texting ."
O,OK .
O,And then obviously we stopped .
O,Yes .
O,And then what happened was a couple months would go by and then I would slide in .
O,Or he would slide in .
O,And every time it was like we picked up right where we left off .
O,You .
O,OK .
O,You .
O,Stifel .
O,"And the thing is , is that I did not see him for the next I think it was year , maybe two years ."
O,"And he slid in one day and was like , hey , you're coming here to come visit me ."
O,I'm buying you a plane ticket .
O,I hopped on a plane and went and spent the weekend with him .
O,That is so .
O,That's what I'm saying is we would only talk every few months .
O,Yeah .
O,I did not see him in person for a year to two years .
O,And we still like rekindled that old flame .
O,That's so brilliant .
O,You a little quarantine bitches complaining about a few months .
O,Get lives .
O,Get out .
O,"That's such a good fucking point , Sophia ."
O,Yeah .
O,So you lived it .
O,You breathed it .
O,And there can be a fucking month .
O,There can be two months .
O,Yeah .
O,They like you .
O,You're gonna be fine .
O,I can slide the fuck back in .
O,"And that I think I want to highlight because I think specifically during this time the alternative to disappearing four bits of time , it doesn't have to be as dramatic as you was is talking to them every fucking day with nothing substantial to say ."
O,OK .
O,What I've been noticing is right now every single day is Groundhog Day .
O,"Oh , it's so hard every single day ."
O,I can't stand to fucking look at your face .
O,You look the same every day .
O,We literally know when it's true .
O,"Guys , it's like you're doing the same shit over and over right now ."
O,And I can guarantee you motherfuckers that if you don't talk to these people for a month and then you pop the fuck back in and you ask them the same question that you asked them a month before .
O,"Hey , what's up ?"
O,They're gonna give you the same fucking answer .
O,They're sitting on the same couch cushion right in the same bag of fucking Doritos .
O,Why the same goddamn Netflix show ?
O,"Yeah , they're not going anywhere ."
O,So you forcing dumb conversation every day .
O,Every day .
O,It's it's dumb .
O,It's diluting the relationship .
O,Diluting the relationship .
O,That's what it is .
O,I'm dealing with this right now .
O,Can you know it's hard .
O,"It's I mean , I know you're dealing with it because we're dealing with ."
O,Yes .
O,So I'm dealing with this right now .
O,I am talking to this guy from L.A. and I don't really think I've talked about him on the pod cheeses .
O,How do you keep track ?
O,No .
O,"And this guy , Canadian guy , California guy ."
O,"Oh , my guy ."
O,I know .
O,We bought an L.A. guy .
O,I know .
O,"So I have to say , I'm crushing on him hard ."
O,I .
O,He's like d I think my ideal man .
O,Yeah .
O,"I've already talked to you about this when we were drunk from the physical aspect to the personality , like he really is the full package and we're really vibing ."
O,And so I began talking to this guy and we were at that point where the next step was for me to get on a plane and go see him .
O,Yeah .
O,You were about to buy a ticket excuse .
O,He was about to buy ticket and then quarantine hit .
O,Right .
O,So everything kind of got fucked up .
O,And now where I'm at right now in quarantine is I'm just trying to figure out how to balance talking with him and then not overdoing it .
O,So .
O,Right .
O,I want to kind of share my technique that Sofia and I have created for this issue .
O,But it's working .
O,It's working .
O,So I am doing the pop in and pop out every few days .
O,"techni , OK ."
O,I like that .
O,"So but only when I do pop in , I'm sending something of substance that's interesting and that warrants conversation ."
O,I'm not just texting this motherfucker .
O,"Hey , what's up every morning ?"
O,"Hey , I'm so glad you brought that up because listen , if you are a bad texter , I really need you to like look in word and realize that about yourself ."
O,"And if you are a bad texter , then you absolutely need to be ."
O,Go .
O,Yeah .
O,You need to be using this little disappearing cage totally .
O,Yeah .
O,"And actually , even if he is a bad texter , you should ghost ."
O,"This is the thing is that generic conversations , you're going to end up shooting yourself in the foot and it really does take two to fucking tango ."
O,Right .
O,You guys both need to be interesting because that's a thing .
O,And it's not like he doesn't like you or you don't like him if you're a bad texter .
O,There are people that are so good impression and say shitty text .
O,"Maybe texting isn't his strong suit , but he's like a fucking animal in the sack ."
O,"Yeah , great ."
O,"But either way , just disappear ."
O,Disappearing is better than having stupid conversation .
O,I agree .
O,And and I want to give you guys like concrete examples .
O,"So what I was saying was when I do decide to slide in every few days , what I'm doing is I'm coming in with entertaining shit ."
O,"And what I mean by that is , for example , the other week Sophia and I were playing Scrabble ."
O,I remember it fun .
O,"And you and I had spelt out the words like sluts lie , sex , you know , classical or ."
O,Yeah .
O,To call her daddy scrabble board .
O,And so we were laughing our asses off .
O,We were having fun .
O,And so what I did is I took a picture of the board and those words and I came up with a funny joke and I sent it to him .
O,And that was the joke .
O,I kind of forget .
O,And then he ended up sending me back a picture of what he was doing .
O,"And it was a great read , vexation ."
O,I'm pretty sure that you sent that picture with the joke to multiple men in your phonebook .
O,Right ?
O,"I remember I did do that , but I think that's more so ."
O,It just saved the brain power .
O,There's only so much content that could go around these days .
O,You got it .
O,You got to maximize it .
O,"Ultimately , having people write , copy and paste that shit ."
O,Don't waste energy .
O,"That's another tip , right ?"
O,"Do make sure , however , to talk about what you guys are going to do when this whole quarantine is over ."
O,A good one .
O,"Just so that you're like putting that out into the universe and like you don't to be detailed , you can say something simple like , oh , my gosh , like when this is over , we better go for a walk on the water like Jesus walk across an order ."
O,You never want him to talk to you again .
O,"You can say , oh , I'm really go ahead and say , no , we're going to try it again ."
O,Okay .
O,You you guys can come up with something better .
O,"But you got my bowling alley , babe ."
O,You got my point .
O,"Yeah , I think that that is specifically smart in quarantine ."
O,"If you have one conversation about that , it allows you then almost even more leeway once you do kind of disappear and fall back a little bit from right them because it's like you let them know you're interested ."
O,Post corn tiang out .
O,"But for right now , I'm not interested in having this conversation ."
O,That is the same every day .
O,"Yes , I know that this is super hard right now because everyone is sitting at home bored ."

O,But let me phrase it this way .
O,"You decided to do a little cheat , scoot and boogie and you cheated on your boyfriend ."
O,No .
O,Please listen .
O,"She's cute , mook ."
O,And you cheated on your boyfriend and you got the clap .
O,"What's worse , you having a little threesome with your boyfriend and then blaming it on the home or you having to go to your boyfriend and say , hey , I cheated on you and I gave you an nice TV either ."
O,Go ahead .
O,As a threesome up in this bed .
O,Up in this bitch .
O,And this is the beauty .
O,"I can see people being like , but I don't want to normalize threesomes ."
O,I don't want him to think I'm going to do that all time .
O,That's fine .
O,This is a perfect in and out move right here .
O,You through losing it .
O,"You throw the pussy , you got the three sub and you throw the two pussies at em ."
O,"And then once you guys that she gave you guys both in SCD , you say we're never having a threesome again ."
O,Fuck that .
O,Fuck this river mine .
O,That was too risk .
O,Yeah .
O,Back to the two of us .
O,"Lock the door , guy ."
O,"No one's ever allowed back in , guys ."
O,You can back off Januarys .
O,"Yeah , but what you can say , like you backpedal after he finds out that you gave him fucking chlamydia ."
O,No .
O,All right .
O,There's a couple things with it .
O,OK .
O,Yes .
O,So if it's a very serious us TDE like a life .
O,Yeah .
O,If you're fucking with like HIV .
O,"This I'm going to go ahead and say absolutely not , don't you ?"
O,This is shit you can solve with like a pill pillinger .
O,Yeah .
O,The minor SCD .
O,Yeah .
O,Second thing .
O,Some of you might have to do a threesome that night .
O,Okay .
O,"You see you've been holding out sex for two weeks cause you're like , my god , I am about to give him HPV or whatever it is I ."
O,Right .
O,Right .
O,So you have to hire an escort .
O,Yeah .
O,Like it's the only way .
O,The only way .
O,That's how you're gonna get a last minute girl to come up or a guy .
O,Take your boys and you could do a threesome with two girls .
O,Two guys would outright lutely .
O,"Your boyfriend might be like , hey , I think we got to wrap it up and use a condom ."
O,Mm hmm .
O,Respectable guy retrospective .
O,Yes .
O,But that totally fucks your plan up .
O,It .
O,But you .
O,What do you do ?
O,Let me just say something .
O,A guy is never as vulnerable .
O,"Alex , you can agree with me on this ."
O,As when he is hard and he is horny and he is about to ejaculate .
O,"So true , he is never as vulnerable as Roman ever ."
O,You quickly whip off the condom and fuckin slam your pussy on to the dick .
O,"It's like whack a mole , but with your vagina and his dick is the mole ."
O,You like that ?
O,Look like you go right .
O,"You swipe up the economy , you pop down and then you put her on his dick and then he doesn't know and he either won't know or if if there's no way you can get away with that ."
O,Right .
O,Okay .
O,And you're not as smooth as some of the rest is slick and smooth like us .
O,"Then what you can do is and this is so fucking easy , cause I know every guy I've ever hooked up with would fall for this ."
O,"Okay , babe ."
O,Babe .
O,Her pussy feels so fucking good .
O,You can be fingering her pussy .
O,Yeah .
O,Great .
O,It feels so good .
O,I want you to feel her .
O,"And then you could even turn to the bitch and be like I want you with your mouth to take his condom off , turn it into sexual foreplay , turn it into something sexy ."
O,Mind he is ripping the condom off and shutting it up and blow it up like a balloon and flicking it out of the window .
O,And while love .
O,There you go .
O,You all got chlamydia and you gave it to him .
O,We don't know .
O,And it's not on you anymore .
O,And the whole thing is done .
O,So that's just like a little .
O,It's just like a little tip that we wanted to give you guys .
O,"No , but like actually straight up , if you are really scared to throw a threesome at your boyfriend or girlfriend ."
O,Yeah .
O,And then boom .
O,Who ?
O,Right .
O,"And you blame it on Edward or if you're like newly talking to someone , telling him that you got an asshole from dirty dick or dirty vagina a month into like dating ."
O,That's not a good look .
O,You know what is a great look ?
O,"Threesome , Bill ?"
O,Show him you're a kinky bitch .
O,Show what you got .
O,OK .
O,"Next , let's talk about facials ."
O,"Yeah , I have a lot of bitches in the DMV ."
O,"Hey , girl , girl ."
O,Wondering how exactly can you tell us what my face is ?
O,"To look like at my body is going to look like when I'm getting a facial , I do , I receive a facial and the best way possible and it's and I respect you all for really wanting to give your man that show ."
O,So here we are .
O,He's jacking off or you're sucking his dick .
O,"Whatever the fuck it is , he's about to give you a facial ."
O,Yeah .
O,I want to make sure everyone understands .
O,Open your mouth .
O,"Think when a man is going to come on your face , you open your mouth ."
O,You want to make him think that you are hoping that you get to hate it all .
O,Ice cream you want .
O,Fucking good ass milk .
O,Yes .
O,No .
O,You want it ?
O,OK .
O,The second part is I suggest you put your tongue out .
O,How far is up to you ?
O,I personally just kind of have it cover my bottom lip a little bit .
O,Like I only put it out a little bit .
O,Right .
O,"I'm not doing you know , I have a wagging tongue ."
O,"No , not the wagging peace sign like , yo , what's up ?"
O,I'm in 7th grade again .
O,But you could I also .
O,It depends what you where you are .
O,"If you're on the ground or what not , but what you're gonna do with your hands is up to you ."
O,Push your tits together .
O,You could take your hands and like kind of pull your hair by .
O,You could lean back on your superhot .
O,"So then what you're going to do is close your eyes , close your eyes ."
O,And now you're all wondering .
O,"But when I'm pretty sure it's pretty like you can see when a man is about to , you know , when he's about , you know , there's pulsating in the dick ."
O,Moaning is getting a little more intense the minute you think he's about to come .
O,Close your eyes .
O,Yeah .
O,"And a lot of guys will announce , yeah , I'm about to ."
O,"And I think that thing that some girls are super self-conscious about is like looking down to like , wait , so I'm putting my tongue out ."
O,I'm closing my eyes .
O,And I'm under his dick looking up and just going like like also girls make that noise .
O,Okay .
O,Hot .
O,Let me ask you this .
O,"What would you rather God goals or what would you rather you sit there with your mouth closed , eyes blinking and just waiting , you're in the line of fucking eyeball ?"
O,I don't think so .
O,"No , I don't think so ."
O,So you guys mouth open tongue .
O,Our eyes are open until you feel he's about to come .
O,Then you close them .
O,Yeah .
O,"The thing is , it's like go watch porn ."
O,"If you're at all confused , it's gonna be a way more intense version ."
O,A lot of them are gonna keep their eyes open because these are professionals they want to risque .
O,"But girls , you will never look more beautiful to a man when his cum is glazed over your face ."
O,Right .
O,"Donia Krispy Kreme , Krispy Mug ."
O,The way you feel about that doughnut is how he feels about you .
O,"And then once he's finished , take your fingers and wipe that come up , put it in your mouth and look at you and then you can go take care of yourself ."
O,"Yeah , right ."
O,"I think sometimes girls are like , well , is he supposed to shoot it into my mouth or is he supposed to shoot it onto my forehand ?"
O,They're all over .
O,All over .
O,And you're just hoping that a little drip goes into your mouth .
O,That's what it should look like .
O,Yeah .
O,Know ?
O,"No , that's it ."
O,That's a tip number three .
O,"Tip number , mother ."
O,And this is gonna help you spice things up during Corona if you're already in like the sexting game with this guy .
O,"There is this thing that you can do and it does not involve your vagina , your tits or your asshole ."
O,"You guys are like , what in the world ?"
O,What could it involve ?
O,It involves your fingers .
O,Let me explain .
O,Okay .
O,"You sending a video to a guy , a quick little clip of you licking your fingers and sucking on them like you are just imagining it's a dick is going to put him over the edge ."
O,Over the way that I've done this .
O,"Well , I'm like thinking about it ."
O,"And I sent a video like this pretty early on with suit , man ."
O,Were and I like horror .
O,Wow .
O,That's how we pay .
O,How I've done it is I will grab two fingers again .
O,This is like get creative .
O,I know some girls .
O,Maybe you want to stick your whole fist in your mouth .
O,Let him know you can take it to the right .
O,"For me personally , I like to do the two fingers ."
O,I take the pointer finger and the middle finger and I'll hold them up .
O,And there will be like a little slit in between .
O,Like read between the lines to pay it .
O,Shit .
O,Got it .
O,And I will lick up the middle so you can kind of see my tongue poking out .
O,And then I will go back down onto both of my fingers with my entire mouth like it's a blow job and then suck it back up .
O,Usually you're going to want to make sure your fingers are wet before this .
O,Yeah .
O,"For example , if you want to kind of ease your way into this or come up with a reason why you're sending this video , what you can say is , baby , I've been thinking about you and I've gotten so wet and I'm going to lick my wetness off my fingers ."
O,"I want to show you , Soha , something like something like send the video , boom ."
O,Make him fall in love .
O,Make him fall in love .
O,"Corona , love , megaphone , love , baby , baby , but magowan love , baby , baby ."
O,Want a one ?
O,Lick the fingers .
O,OK .
O,"I think that's so fucking smart , Sophia , and I appreciate you ."
O,And I don't think it's very common for girls to do it .
O,So I like your yourself either .
O,But try really hard to make sure that your fingers are wet .
O,And I do .
O,And another tip last for this one is I think sometimes girls get in their heads .
O,It's kind of similar to the facial thing .
O,"Taking a video , sucking your fingers ."
O,My big suggestion is we always say fake it till you make it .
O,"But in these situations , you can ."
O,But .
O,If you can actually be like genuinely turned on .
O,"Yeah , that will show through in this video and in your facial , etc. ."
O,So if you're getting a facial and you need to be rubbing your clit or if you're licking your fingers and you need to be masturbating right in like manner that acting did acting .
O,"I mean , the joker ."
O,Okay .
O,Here we go .
O,Yes .
O,Joaquin Phoenix .
O,Yes .
O,He fucking got into that character's so hardcore .
O,He said he went a little crazy .
O,Yes .
O,This is where you channel your inner porn star .
O,Make yourself believe only that your fingers are a day you die .
O,Me ?
O,Yes .
O,Because it will play off differently if you're looking at it like that .
O,And I think that's brilliant .
O,"Even if you are a Mary Beth , if you're a sweet heart , you can still turn out and be a freak on your finger ."
O,You know what I mean ?
O,"Just believing is seeing kind of like the Santa , the you know , when I'm seeing cousin Santa Claus ."
O,"Anyways , moving on ."
O,"Okay , guys , this is I'm excited ."
O,Our last tip and this is the biggest one .
O,We saved the best for last .
O,"This is a big , fat , huge reminder for you all that you are just a hole , at the end of the day you are just a hole ."
O,"That sounds harsh , but you are just a hole ."
O,"Specifically your three , you are just three holes ."
O,"Yeah , and he's trying to figure out which one to put it and we've said it once ."
O,I must say it again .
O,"Why are we bring this up , Sophia ?"
O,I would say the majority of submissions we get from Daddy Gang are from a girl saying my fuck boy is just using me for sex right now .
O,How do I make him want to wife me up ?
O,"And the thing is , you don't ."
O,"You don't , you don't ."
O,Why are we get what ?
O,What have have we taught you ?
O,Nothing .
O,Have we taught you ?
O,Not guys .
O,You don't .
O,You don't .
O,And if you want him to .
O,"If there is any hope , you gotta even also act like you don't want him to think ."
O,"If you're acting like you want , you're if you have the mentality that you want your fuck boy to wipe you up ."
O,You are trash .
O,You are nothing .
O,Get your fucking head .
O,"Guys , this was kind of also brought up because on top of daddy being writing in , Sofia and I were watching a reality television show , Vanderpump Rules ."
O,Yes .
O,I want this little homework for you guys .
O,All right .
O,"You guys are gonna go to Season 8 of Vanderpump Rules and you're gonna watch the first two episodes in the season , Episode 1 in episode tube's his name ."
O,And you are going to specifically focus on this girl named Sheena Shay .
O,Sheena Shea is the definition of everything .
O,We do not want you to do here on call is the definition of a walking hole pretending she's not a walking hole .
O,"OK , little yet ."
O,Qena in her mind believes every word that every fuck boy said .
O,Yes .
O,"And then when they fuck her over , she's the girl that shows up at the bar crying , saying , Yeah , Jeffrey ."
O,What ?
O,But you said that you love me .
O,"He wanted to fuck you , and he wanted to fuck you ."
O,Right .
O,And then you got annoying as fuck and you got clingy and you got in your mindset that you thought that you that he owed you anything other than Dick .
O,"So much so that the guys when the cameras are turned to them and she's not there , they're all talking about how she's a stage five clean klingner ."
O,OK .
O,Can you imagine if you were being called a stage five clinger ?
O,That should be your goal in life to ensure that you are never called that .
O,Because I think of men that could be maybe possibly the worst fucking insult .
O,"And listen , we're talking out Sheena Shea ."
O,We're talking about the daddy game .
O,I I I have her got in my place in this world as a whole .
O,Absolutely .
O,I dunno .
O,I've been in a situation where I've tried to convince myself that the relationship was something more than it was .
O,I've done it .
O,Alex has done it .
O,We've all done it .
O,"Yeah , but the sooner that you can accept that you're just a hole , the quicker you can move on to a guy ."
O,This is me being on it .
O,Yeah .
O,A guy that will see you as a hole with a face .
O,Hell of a hole with a face like you .
O,"It's so fucked up , but it's so also poetic and beautiful ."
O,"You're like , he may see you have a face ."
O,Holy shit .
O,A glorious day for all of us .
O,Daddy gang .
O,Yes .
O,It's so fucking true .
O,"Guys , one of the scenes in the fucking show ."
O,This guy that was is a complete fuck boy fucks like the entire staff at the restaurant they all work at .
O,She got she got emotional and Cina believed all the sweet nothings he was with .
O,Right .
O,I just care so much about Ray Shi on in this scene .
O,She's .
O,She pulled up the text messages and started reading them back .
O,"She's like , but you said this ."
O,Yeah .
O,"He literally is like , no , I did it ."
O,Yeah .
O,"She starts reading a fuck , boy , the things that he was saying ."
O,And you almost want to shake the girl and be like he said he liked you because he wanted right to fuck you .
O,Explain that a little more .
O,Yes .
O,What happens is this guy starts texting you stuff like I've been thinking about you all day .
O,I can't stop .
O,Think you're dead .
O,You're different than all the other girls .
O,You're beautiful .
O,I just .
O,Why ?
O,"Hey , Michelle ."
O,I miss I miss you .
O,"I love just laying and chilling with you like you're such a chill , fun girl ."
O,And then what happens is these girls take comments like that and think that there is all of a sudden a future .
O,"And unfortunately , what it is , is it's them wanting to fuck your pussy , fuck your pussy ."
O,That's literally that's it .
O,Guys will say anything to get in a girl's pants .
O,"milfhunter has literally told us in the EB the milfhunter episode , we go ."
O,OK .
O,What if a girl says that she loves you and he's like .
O,I say I love her .
O,Right .
O,"And we're like , what ?"
O,"He's like , Yeah , I'm not ready to lose the pussy ."
O,I'll say whatever I need to to ensure that I got the pussy .
O,These men are throwing around the L-O-V-E .
O,Men are only willing .
O,"To lose pussy on their terms , and so they are going to continue to say whatever the fuck they want in order to keep fucking you ."
O,And it is your job to make sure that every single thing that man says to you goes in one ear and out the other .
O,Selective hearing .
O,"Selective hearing , you guys ."
O,I'm not kidding .
O,"Until this guy sits you down and he's like , I want you to be my girlfriend ."
O,I want to be exclusive .
O,I want us to be in a committed relationship .
O,You gotta let everything else he says go in one ear and out the .
O,Absolutely .
O,I .
O,I think that especially in quarantine .
O,I've been seeing bitches writing in like it's just so annoying .
O,"He only answers me when , like I send him something sexual ."
O,"If you can't get a fuckin text back in quarantine , you are not shit ."
O,Bottom oh other fuckin barrel .
O,"You're like , oh , half a hole ."
O,Oh you half .
O,A quarter of one .
O,I'm going to just be very open and vulnerable and honest here because this is what we do here on call her daddy .
O,When I was a sophomore at Boston University .
O,Here we go .
O,Here we go .
O,Here she goes .
O,"I've never I think I've heard this story , so I don't go because it's so fucking it does not fully recovered ."
O,"Oh , no ."
O,"Well , you know what it is ?"
O,You and I want everyone .
O,It is good to encounter a fuck .
O,"It is because and there is a lot of times you can encounter them , but there will always be that one that literally changed the trajectory of how you look at men , and sometimes you need that to wake you the fuck ."
O,"So I was a sophomore and I started dating a Red Sox player that was 30 years older than me , 13 years older than little sophomore Alex ."
O,I thought I had it all in my mind .
O,We were together living and loving and cherishing .
O,You were together every other Tuesday .
O,I'm sorry .
O,Pathetic .
O,He was a professional baseball player on the Red Sox .
O,And you were a sophomore in college and you thought .
O,I thought that you guys were something .
O,I had not something .
O,I had nothing .
O,This is the thing .
O,"Like , I remember that experience ."
O,"One , I understand ."
O,"Like , it's hard sometimes as women , especially how emotional we can be like ."
O,Yeah .
O,"When you are infatuated with a boy , it's really hard to fuckin see shit ."
O,You've blinders on .
O,Yeah .
O,"And I have been there and Sophie and I are not better than any you know , I have done as we've learned from our experiences ."
O,And that's why we have this yard .
O,It has .
O,I remember her with my fuck boy .
O,Yeah .
O,I was the girl he would text every time he broke up with his girl .
O,Oh .
O,All ex high would literally just be there waiting for you .
O,I am behind his house and I just remember I really believed I was like over one of these times .
O,I'll be the girlfriend .
O,I just know it .
O,"You're like , it's coming ."
O,And it's like .
O,"You see how he's made seven girls , his girlfriend and not you ."
O,So that's probably not going through your fucking head now .
O,Yeah .
O,"And at the end of the day , until he looks you in the face and he says , be my wife , be my wife , be my let's ."
O,Okay .
O,We can dumb it down a little .
O,Be my girlfriend .
O,Yeah .
O,And when I say that I need you to .
O,You need to be badger about .
O,Please be my girlfriend .
O,It needs to be the 10th time .
O,Ask me if you really fucking means it .
O,Yeah .
O,If he's gonna work a little for it .
O,Last thing I want to say .
O,Sometimes you just gotta take the L and move on .
O,Take the loss .
O,Move on .
O,Because a lot of times too with fuck boys .
O,"If you disappear , your chances of the fuck boy coming back around are way fucking higher than you being the annoying ass cunt that right fuck and leave aside ."
O,And he's like .
O,"Jesus Christ , I could run this bitch over ."
O,"And Shibulal , but I still love you , isn't it ?"
O,Right ?
O,Johnny .
O,"No , Johnny ."
O,Two-Shoes fucking hates you .
O,Yes .
O,"We don't want to give you guys false hope , but if you want even a fuckin fighting chance , then you got a dissappear goes down ."
O,Voll temporarily .
O,Take the L .
O,"All right , let's get to a little ."
O,A little take a trip to France .
O,"We're going to do a little thing I like to call quiz , Jim ."
O,"Oh , like glass of the White Barber ."
O,"Oh , well , the costumes of the motherfucking week ."
O,OK .
O,OK .
O,Here we go .
O,This what ?
O,I'm going to kick it off .
O,"Hi , Ford ."
O,"Oh , God ."
O,"Hey , Daddy's ."
O,I guess this is just a quick little hack for girls in quarantine .
O,I thought this was cute and I think I've done this before .
O,She said sometimes on days where I feel like my body looks great .
O,I'll just grab some of my hottest underwear and bras and stuff like that .
O,And I'll take pictures in each combination of the laundry stuff or just cute little outfits that look good together .
O,And then I'm set for pictures for weeks during quarantine .
O,I think it's so brilliant .
O,I have been so mad at myself at times .
O,"If , like , I got a good spray tan , I got my hair done ."
O,"I'm like , why the fuck wasn't I ?"
O,In my laundry taking pics so that he slides in at 2 a.m. and you're sexting and you're ready to send him picture and you look like a fucking generate disgust .
O,"Yeah , you could just go back to that ."
O,"So I think that's a really good idea of you , especially in KORSNES ."
O,"You guys are broad , right ?"
O,Pick one day right now .
O,"Well , a lot of us have a ton of time on our hands ."
O,I was just sitting in our room .
O,Right .
O,Have a little photoshoot .
O,That is such a good subject .
O,Yeah .
O,Stock up greeting Poppy's .
O,I need some advice on dealing with ego issues .
O,I guess my ex and I broke up after two years in December .
O,"The breakup was amicable and if anything , I wanted it more ."
O,I heard you started dating someone new at the beginning of the year and was happy for him .
O,"However , I just found out he's quarantining with this new lady because he posted a picture of them both together and she is a knockout ."
O,Ten out of ten Victoria's Secret looking bitch .
O,I got so jealous and instantly obviously hated her .
O,How do I deal thing ?
O,Really tough .
O,"When you break up with someone , I think that you should unfollow them ."
O,I agree .
O,So that you don't even need to worry about something like this happening .
O,"Out of sight , out of mind ."
O,"And obviously that for some reason , because I know some people that would create a lot of drama ."
O,You can mewe people's posts in stories .
O,OK .
O,Ever see their shit ?
O,Briley you need to be doing that at least .
O,Yes .
O,"Then on the flip side , because I don't want to be a complete hypocrite ."
O,Yeah .
O,"Alex and I both have been there where not only do we still follow them , but we go and look for the new girls that they're dating up ."
O,I've done that before .
O,And you just gotta be ready for something like that .
O,"Because if she went and looked at this girl and this girl would have been busted as fuck , would you care ?"
O,Would you laugh ?
O,You would laugh .
O,You would feel better that you would feel better about it just because she's fucking hot .
O,And it sad .
O,Yes .
O,"And I mean , also girly you ."
O,This is very superficial .
O,You know what ?
O,He's with like a C. .
O,So it makes you feel better .
O,Convince yourself that she sucks and bad .
O,Yeah .
O,And she's an idiot .
O,Boring as fuck .
O,And also everyone in fucking quarantine right out there quarantining with someone that they're not fully in love with .
O,I'm sure that relation is going to end .
O,All right .
O,They're going to break up .
O,Yeah .
O,They'll be bored .
O,And also you to just think about it like you know him so well .
O,You know what that girl is getting from him and it wasn't enough for you .
O,So it's probably .
O,Who cares what she's getting ?
O,It wasn't enough for you .
O,"And like , that's that ."
O,"And you got to just like own that and like , go focus on yourself ."
O,But I get it .
O,It's I fucking do it .
O,And we stalk like motherfuckers and it can hurt .
O,And then you honestly talk the way Sophie and I talk about it .
O,Find a friend that will let you just fucking talk about it and jack round .
O,Yeah .
O,And then you got to move on .
O,Yes .
O,Yeah .
B-AD,Hi Daddy gang .
I-AD,So I have a new hack for the ladies .
I-AD,"If you're insecure about the way you taste when a guy is going down on you or want to taste more sweet , there's his badge and I'll melt that you insert inside of you and they melt and leave your vagina smelling and tasting great for hours ."
I-AD,It also gives you a lubrication from the oils .
I-AD,The Web site is called Somali for Malé and they have so many flavors to choose from .
I-AD,"Guys , you spell that f e m a l l a y ."
I-AD,So I looked up this Web site because I was feeling this actually sounds fucking cool because who doesn't want her fucking .
I-AD,Amazing .
I-AD,And it gives you lubrication .
I-AD,Ray .
I-AD,I read reviews .
I-AD,"Obviously , I was like , nervous because I'm like , is this a fuckin gyno meeting waiting to happen ?"
I-AD,Because I get like that .
I-AD,"I was going to say I read as many reviews as I could and a lot a majority of them were positive people being like , holy shit , my vagina was like so wet and like , smelled great ."
I-AD,Tasted great .
I-AD,Okay .
I-AD,Something to try this .
I-AD,I'm gonna go buy two .
I-AD,I literally have on my computer and I want to go buy .
I-AD,The reason I love this is because I've heard of putting stuff on the outside to make it taste good .
I-AD,This straight goes in the angles inside and it mel out .
I-AD,"So you guys have to like lay on your bed and it's almost like , yeah , you're just waiting for it ."
I-AD,And then do it like a little bit before your dick appointment .
I-AD,Yeah .
I-AD,The night before .
I-AD,And then you go in there and it's lubed up and it fuckin smells great .
I-AD,I mean why .
E-AD,Amazing .
O,Okay .
O,This is so smart .
O,Okay .
O,Men need to listen .
O,This Gordon said hi .
O,"Daddys just wanted to say that as a single girl swiping on Tinder , when a guy stands next to a taller guy in one of the pictures , it makes him look short ."
O,It doesn't matter if he's six one and the other guy is 6 7 .
O,The 6 1 guy still looks shorter and it's not attractive .
O,I've swiped left on multiple guys after thinking their faces were que- because I was afraid they would be shorter than me .
O,Just me .
O,Love the podcast .
O,Keeping sexy and amazing lady .
O,Brilliant .
O,Brilliant .
O,If you happen to me the other day .
O,Right ?
O,"Even if you're a short guy or a tall guy , it's all about ratio ."
O,And do not stand next to your fucking basketball player frat dude .
O,He's literally said it to girls on the other end .
O,"Like , don't fucking stand next to your friend ."
O,It looks like megane far right ?
O,And you look like a troll under a bridge less .
O,Maybe pick an uglier friend or just buy your fucking cell .
O,"Yes , guys , it's so funny you brought this up ."
O,I was on the dating app the other day and I get this guy's first picture was him and he looks really cute .
O,He was a hockey player .
O,No fucking shocker there .
O,Click on to the next picture .
O,He's walking down the rink hallway and there's two of his teammates with him .
O,"And oh , now I say hey ."
O,"And I'm like , hold on ."
O,This looks like he's so .
O,"And again , there's nothing short with ."
O,There's nothing wrong .
O,There's nothing short with short guys .
O,There's nothing wrong with short guy .
O,"The issue is , is there it's not making you look manly , manly and masculine ."
O,"Like , why are you picking a picture array that you look like the little guy I like ?"
O,Come on .
O,"When you're on a dating app , it's all superficial at first and put your best foot forward ."
O,Okay .
O,I agree .
O,"Just that is a good tip for guys , not just us being on it ."
O,"Yeah , there's absolutely nothing fucking wrong with short guy ."
O,No .
O,Just don't over emphasize .
O,Right .
O,It's just that would just blend here .
O,And if you're 6 1 you're gonna look like you're 5 5 .
O,"If you're standing next to like , you know , that's a good LeBron James , right ?"
O,Boom .
O,"Hi , fathers ."
O,"This question is honestly so gross , but I desperately need an answer ."
O,I spend the night at my boyfriend's house at least five to seven days a week and I practically live there .
O,"Usually if I really need to go the bathroom , I just go back to my apartment and make an excuse ."
O,"However , there's times where I just can't specifically , obviously in quarantine ."
O,"This is usually not something I'm too embarrassed about , but because we have been together for so long ."
O,"When it's the day after drinking or even worse , I'm on my period ."
O,We know how bad that can be .
O,l.o.l .
O,There's no way around it .
O,"I know everyone shits and it's not a huge deal , but I lowkey want to die whenever I have to go out his house ."
O,I just don't know what to do .
O,Can I get your guys thoughts ?
O,How do you go about this ?
O,"Oh , we love we've talked about the infamous PWS situation at Mail's places , but I can imagine it never is any easier ."
O,And did post drinking .

O,"And if you've got the spring Silvia's done , you've got to spray swear to God you won't you won't have anxiety and maybe turn the sink on ."
O,My friend was telling me that she will light a match .
O,I think that's on .
O,That completely gets rid of the smell .
O,"And I'm like , why are you doing ?"
O,"I'm like , that is you're asking him to be like , were you burning something in the back ?"
